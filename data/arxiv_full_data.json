However, adoption of machine learning technologies has a lot of untouched potential. Cost of developing custom machine learning solutions that solve unique business problems is a major inhibitor to far-reaching adoption of machine learning technologies. We recognize that the monolithic nature prevalent in today's machine learning applications stands in the way of efficient and cost effective customized machine learning solution development. In this work we explore the benefits of modular machine learning solutions and discuss how modular machine learning solutions can overcome some of the major solution engineering limitations of monolithic machine learning solutions. We analyze the trade-offs between modular and monolithic machine learning solutions through three deep learning problems; one text based and the two image based. Our experimental results show that modular machine learning solutions have a promising potential to reap the solution engineering advantages of modularity while gaining performance and data advantages in a way the monolithic machine learning solutions do not permit.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the use of machine learning in meteorology has increased greatly. While many machine learning methods are not new, university classes on machine learning are largely unavailable to meteorology students and are not required to become a meteorologist. The lack of formal instruction has contributed to perception that machine learning methods are 'black boxes' and thus end-users are hesitant to apply the machine learning methods in their every day workflow. To reduce the opaqueness of machine learning methods and lower hesitancy towards machine learning in meteorology, this paper provides a survey of some of the most common machine learning methods. A familiar meteorological example is used to contextualize the machine learning methods while also discussing machine learning topics using plain language. The following machine learning methods are demonstrated: linear regression; logistic regression; decision trees; random forest; gradient boosted decision trees; naive Bayes; and support vector machines. Beyond discussing the different methods, the paper also contains discussions on the general machine learning process as well as best practices to enable readers to apply machine learning to their own datasets. Furthermore, all code (in the form of Jupyter notebooks and Google Colaboratory notebooks) used to make the examples in the paper is provided in an effort to catalyse the use of machine learning in meteorology.",

Also, the machine learning process is difficult to automate. This paper proposes building a trustable machine learning system by using blockchain technology, which can store data in a permanent and immutable way. In addition, smart contracts are used to automate the machine learning process. This paper makes three contributions. First, it establishes a link between machine learning technology and blockchain technology. Previously, machine learning and blockchain have been considered two independent technologies without an obvious link. Second, it proposes a unified analytical framework for trustable machine learning by using blockchain technology. This unified framework solves both the trustability and automation issues in machine learning. Third, it enables a computer to translate core machine learning implementation from a single thread on a single machine to multiple threads on multiple machines running with blockchain by using a unified approach. The paper uses association rule mining as an example to demonstrate how trustable machine learning can be implemented with blockchain, and it shows how this approach can be used to analyze opioid prescriptions to help combat the opioid crisis.",

        "abstract": "We conduct an empirical study of machine learning functionalities provided by major cloud service providers, which we call machine learning clouds. Machine learning clouds hold the promise of hiding all the sophistication of running large-scale machine learning: Instead of specifying how to run a machine learning task, users only specify what machine learning task to run and the cloud figures out the rest. Raising the level of abstraction, however, rarely comes free - a performance penalty is possible. How good, then, are current machine learning clouds on real-world machine learning workloads?   We study this question with a focus on binary classication problems. We present mlbench, a novel benchmark constructed by harvesting datasets from Kaggle competitions. We then compare the performance of the top winning code available from Kaggle with that of running machine learning clouds from both Azure and Amazon on mlbench. Our comparative study reveals the strength and weakness of existing machine learning clouds and points out potential future directions for improvement.",

At the same time, machine learning can only succeed by collaboration among many parties in multiple steps naturally as pipelines in an eco-system, such as collecting data for possible machine learning applications, collaboratively training models by multiple parties and delivering machine learning services to end users. Data is critical and penetrating in the whole machine learning pipelines. As machine learning pipelines involve many parties and, in order to be successful, have to form a constructive and dynamic eco-system, marketplaces and data pricing are fundamental in connecting and facilitating those many parties. In this article, we survey the principles and the latest research development of data pricing in machine learning pipelines. We start with a brief review of data marketplaces and pricing desiderata. Then, we focus on pricing in three important steps in machine learning pipelines. To understand pricing in the step of training data collection, we review pricing raw data sets and data labels. We also investigate pricing in the step of collaborative training of machine learning models, and overview pricing machine learning models for end users in the step of machine learning deployment. We also discuss a series of possible future directions.",

In this paper, we review the current developments of AutoML in terms of three categories, automated feature engineering (AutoFE), automated model and hyperparameter learning (AutoMHL), and automated deep learning (AutoDL). State-of-the-art techniques adopted in the three categories are presented, including Bayesian optimization, reinforcement learning, evolutionary algorithm, and gradient-based approaches.

Optimization, as an important part of machine learning, has attracted much attention of researchers. With the exponential growth of data amount and the increase of model complexity, optimization methods in machine learning face more and more challenges. A lot of work on solving optimization problems or improving optimization methods in machine learning has been proposed successively. The systematic retrospect and summary of the optimization methods from the perspective of machine learning are of great significance, which can offer guidance for both developments of optimization and machine learning research. In this paper, we first describe the optimization problems in machine learning. Then, we introduce the principles and progresses of commonly used optimization methods. Next, we summarize the applications and developments of optimization methods in some popular machine learning fields. Finally, we explore and give some challenges and open problems for the optimization in machine learning.",

        "abstract": "The newly emerged machine learning (e.g. deep learning) methods have become a strong driving force to revolutionize a wide range of industries, such as smart healthcare, financial technology, and surveillance systems. Meanwhile, privacy has emerged as a big concern in this machine learning-based artificial intelligence era. It is important to note that the problem of privacy preservation in the context of machine learning is quite different from that in traditional data privacy protection, as machine learning can act as both friend and foe. Currently, the work on the preservation of privacy and machine learning (ML) is still in an infancy stage, as most existing solutions only focus on privacy problems during the machine learning process. Therefore, a comprehensive study on the privacy preservation problems and machine learning is required. This paper surveys the state of the art in privacy issues and solutions for machine learning. The survey covers three categories of interactions between privacy and machine learning: (i) private machine learning, (ii) machine learning aided privacy protection, and (iii) machine learning-based privacy attack and corresponding protection schemes. The current research progress in each category is reviewed and the key challenges are identified. Finally, based on our in-depth analysis of the area of privacy and machine learning, we point out future research directions in this field.",

Geospatial machine learning has key distinctions from other learning paradigms, and as such, the correct way to measure performance of spatial machine learning outputs has been a topic of debate. In this paper, I delineate unique challenges of model evaluation for geospatial machine learning with global or remotely sensed datasets, culminating in concrete takeaways to improve evaluations of geospatial model performance.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning is an established and frequently used technique in industry and academia but a standard process model to improve success and efficiency of machine learning applications is still missing. Project organizations and machine learning practitioners have a need for guidance throughout the life cycle of a machine learning application to meet business expectations. We therefore propose a process model for the development of machine learning applications, that covers six phases from defining the scope to maintaining the deployed machine learning application. The first phase combines business and data understanding as data availability oftentimes affects the feasibility of the project. The sixth phase covers state-of-the-art approaches for monitoring and maintenance of a machine learning applications, as the risk of model degradation in a changing environment is eminent. With each task of the process, we propose quality assurance methodology that is suitable to adress challenges in machine learning development that we identify in form of risks. The methodology is drawn from practical experience and scientific literature and has proven to be general and stable. The process model expands on CRISP-DM, a data mining process model that enjoys strong industry support but lacks to address machine learning specific tasks. Our work proposes an industry and application neutral process model tailored for machine learning applications with focus on technical tasks for quality assurance.",

In many cases, more than two maps are strongly related, so it is wise to make multiplicative unit learn relations among more input maps, in other words, to find the optimal relational-order of each unit. In order to enable our machine to learn relational order, we developed a reinforcement-learning method whose optimality is proven to train the network.",

These datasets are typically generated by large-scale experimental facilities at national laboratories. In the context of science, scientific machine learning focuses on training machines to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies to extract meaningful scientific insights from such datasets. With a new generation of experimental facilities, the rate of data generation and the scale of data volumes will increasingly require the use of more automated data analysis. At present, identifying the most appropriate machine learning algorithm for the analysis of any given scientific dataset is still a challenge for scientists. This is due to many different machine learning frameworks, computer architectures, and machine learning models. Historically, for modelling and simulation on HPC systems such problems have been addressed through benchmarking computer applications, algorithms, and architectures. Extending such a benchmarking approach and identifying metrics for the application of machine learning methods to scientific datasets is a new challenge for both scientists and computer scientists. In this paper, we describe our approach to the development of scientific machine learning benchmarks and review other approaches to benchmarking scientific machine learning.",

These explanations are often used to qualitatively assess other criteria such as safety or non-discrimination. However, despite the interest in interpretability, there is very little consensus on what interpretable machine learning is and how it should be measured. In this position paper, we first define interpretability and describe when interpretability is needed (and when it is not). Next, we suggest a taxonomy for rigorous evaluation and expose open questions towards a more rigorous science of interpretable machine learning.",

In this paper we propose a short curriculum for a course about uncertainty in machine learning, and complement the course with a selection of use cases, aimed to trigger discussion and let students play with the concepts of uncertainty in a programming setting. Our use cases cover the concept of output uncertainty, Bayesian neural networks and weight distributions, sources of uncertainty, and out of distribution detection. We expect that this curriculum and set of use cases motivates the community to adopt these important concepts into courses for safety in AI.",

Unfortunately, the syntax for automated machine learning tools is inconsistent with manual machine learning, with each other, and with error checks. Furthermore, few tools support advanced features such as topology search or higher-order operators. This paper introduces Lale, a library of high-level Python interfaces that simplifies and unifies automated machine learning in a consistent way.",

To survive in such an ecosystem, machine learning models need to adapt to new conditions by evolving over time. The idea of model adaptability has been studied from different perspectives. In this paper, we propose a solution based on reusing the knowledge acquired by the already deployed machine learning models and leveraging it to train future generations.

Machine Learning models are represented as functions, and the characteristics in scope depend upon the domain of the function, what allows us to adopt topological and metric spaces theory as a basis. Finally, this work provides some equivalences useful to prove and test stability in Machine Learning models.

We consider a distributed learning setup in which a machine learning model is trained over a large number of devices that can harvest energy from the ambient environment, and develop a practical learning framework with theoretical convergence guarantees. We demonstrate through numerical experiments that the proposed framework can significantly outperform energy-agnostic benchmarks. Our framework is scalable, requires only local estimation of the energy statistics, and can be applied to a wide range of distributed training settings, including machine learning in wireless networks, edge computing, and mobile internet of things.",

Learning better representations is critical to improve the performance of downstream tasks. Due to the advances in machine learning, we now can learn better and meaningful representations from EHR through disentangling the underlying factors inside data and distilling large amounts of information and knowledge from heterogeneous EHR sources. In this chapter, we first introduce the background of learning representations and reasons why we need good EHR representations in machine learning for medicine and healthcare in Section 1. Next, we explain the commonly-used machine learning and evaluation methods for representation learning using a deep learning approach in Section 2. Following that, we review recent related studies of learning patient state representation from EHR for clinical machine learning tasks in Section 3. Finally, in Section 4 we discuss more techniques, studies, and challenges for learning natural language representations when free texts, such as clinical notes, examination reports, or biomedical literature are used. We also discuss challenges and opportunities in these rapidly growing research fields.",

In this work, we say \"yes\" by applying plain old SQL to deep learning, in a sense implementing deep learning algorithms with SQL. Most deep learning frameworks, as well as generic machine learning ones, share a de facto standard of multidimensional array operations, underneath fancier infrastructure such as automatic differentiation. As SQL tables can be regarded as generalisations of (multi-dimensional) arrays, we have found a way to express common deep learning operations in SQL, encouraging a different way of thinking and thus potentially novel models. In particular, one of the latest trend in deep learning was the introduction of sparsity in the name of graph convolutional networks, whereas we take sparsity almost for granted in the database world. As both databases and machine learning involve transformation of datasets, we hope this work can inspire further works utilizing the large body of existing wisdom, algorithms and technologies in the database field to advance the state of the art in machine learning, rather than merely integerating machine learning into databases.",

        "abstract": "The term \"interpretability\" is oftenly used by machine learning researchers each with their own intuitive understanding of it. There is no universal well agreed upon definition of interpretability in machine learning. As any type of science discipline is mainly driven by the set of formulated questions rather than by different tools in that discipline, e.g. astrophysics is the discipline that learns the composition of stars, not as the discipline that use the spectroscopes. Similarly, we propose that machine learning interpretability should be a discipline that answers specific questions related to interpretability. These questions can be of statistical, causal and counterfactual nature. Therefore, there is a need to look into the interpretability problem of machine learning in the context of questions that need to be addressed rather than different tools. We discuss about a hypothetical interpretability framework driven by a question based scientific approach rather than some specific machine learning model. Using a question based notion of interpretability, we can step towards understanding the science of machine learning rather than its engineering. This notion will also help us understanding any specific problem more in depth rather than relying solely on machine learning methods.",

        "abstract": "The ethics of Machine Learning has become an unavoidable topic in the AI Community. The deployment of machine learning systems in multiple social contexts has resulted in a closer ethical scrutiny of the design, development, and application of these systems. The AI/ML community has come to terms with the imperative to think about the ethical implications of machine learning, not only as a product but also as a practice (Birhane, 2021; Shen et al. 2021). The critical question that is troubling many debates is what can constitute an ethically accountable machine learning system. In this paper we explore possibilities for ethical evaluation of machine learning methodologies. We scrutinize techniques, methods and technical practices in machine learning from a relational ethics perspective, taking into consideration how machine learning systems are part of the world and how they relate to different forms of agency. Taking a page from Phil Agre (1997) we use the notion of a critical technical practice as a means of analysis of machine learning approaches. Our radical proposal is that supervised learning appears to be the only machine learning method that is ethically defensible.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning on graphs has been extensively studied in both academic and industry. However, as the literature on graph learning booms with a vast number of emerging methods and techniques, it becomes increasingly difficult to manually design the optimal machine learning algorithm for different graph-related tasks. To solve this critical challenge, automated machine learning (AutoML) on graphs which combines the strength of graph machine learning and AutoML together, is gaining attention from the research community. Therefore, we comprehensively survey AutoML on graphs in this paper, primarily focusing on hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) and neural architecture search (NAS) for graph machine learning. We further overview libraries related to automated graph machine learning and in-depth discuss AutoGL, the first dedicated open-source library for AutoML on graphs. In the end, we share our insights on future research directions for automated graph machine learning. This paper is the first systematic and comprehensive review of automated machine learning on graphs to the best of our knowledge.",

All model classes of machine learning systems can be misled by providing carefully crafted inputs making them wrongly classify inputs. Maliciously created input samples can affect the learning process of a ML system by either slowing down the learning process, or affecting the performance of the learned mode, or causing the system make error(s) only in attacker's planned scenario. Because of these developments, understanding security of machine learning algorithms and systems is emerging as an important research area among computer security and machine learning researchers and practitioners.

For many applications, deep learning models outperform shallow machine learning models and traditional data analysis approaches. In this article, we summarize the fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning to generate a broader understanding of the methodical underpinning of current intelligent systems. In particular, we provide a conceptual distinction between relevant terms and concepts, explain the process of automated analytical model building through machine learning and deep learning, and discuss the challenges that arise when implementing such intelligent systems in the field of electronic markets and networked business.

In this paper we study this problem for finite state machines with inputs and outputs, and in particular for Moore machines. We develop three algorithms for solving this problem: (1) the PTAP algorithm, which transforms a set of input-output traces into an incomplete Moore machine and then completes the machine with self-loops; (2) the PRPNI algorithm, which uses the well-known RPNI algorithm for automata learning to learn a product of automata encoding a Moore machine; and (3) the MooreMI algorithm, which directly learns a Moore machine using PTAP extended with state merging. We prove that MooreMI has the fundamental identification in the limit property. We also compare the algorithms experimentally in terms of the size of the learned machine and several notions of accuracy, introduced in this paper. Finally, we compare with OSTIA, an algorithm that learns a more general class of transducers, and find that OSTIA generally does not learn a Moore machine, even when fed with a characteristic sample.",

However, we are not aware of quantitative evidence corroborating this popular belief. A quantitative characterization of iteration can serve as a benchmark for machine learning workflow development in practice, and can aid the development of human-in-the-loop machine learning systems. To this end, we conduct a small-scale survey of the applied machine learning literature from five distinct application domains. We collect and distill statistics on the role of iteration within machine learning workflow development, and report preliminary trends and insights from our investigation, as a starting point towards this benchmark. Based on our findings, we finally describe desiderata for effective and versatile human-in-the-loop machine learning systems that can cater to users in diverse domains.",

In this paper, we review and organize practical machine learning safety techniques that can complement engineering safety for machine learning based software in autonomous vehicles. Our organization maps safety strategies to state-of-the-art machine learning techniques in order to enhance dependability and safety of machine learning algorithms. We also discuss security limitations and user experience aspects of machine learning components in autonomous vehicles.",

A simple and efficient programming language could accelerate applications of machine learning in various fields. Currently, the programming languages most commonly used to develop machine learning algorithms include Python, MATLAB, and C/C ++. However, none of these languages well balance both efficiency and simplicity. The Julia language is a fast, easy-to-use, and open-source programming language that was originally designed for high-performance computing, which can well balance the efficiency and simplicity. This paper summarizes the related research work and developments in the application of the Julia language in machine learning. It first surveys the popular machine learning algorithms that are developed in the Julia language. Then, it investigates applications of the machine learning algorithms implemented with the Julia language. Finally, it discusses the open issues and the potential future directions that arise in the use of the Julia language in machine learning.",

        "abstract": "As machine learning becomes more and more available to the general public, theoretical questions are turning into pressing practical issues. Possibly, one of the most relevant concerns is the assessment of our confidence in trusting machine learning predictions. In many real-world cases, it is of utmost importance to estimate the capabilities of a machine learning algorithm to generalize, i.e., to provide accurate predictions on unseen data, depending on the characteristics of the target problem. In this work, we perform a meta-analysis of 109 publicly-available classification data sets, modeling machine learning generalization as a function of a variety of data set characteristics, ranging from number of samples to intrinsic dimensionality, from class-wise feature skewness to $F1$ evaluated on test samples falling outside the convex hull of the training set. Experimental results demonstrate the relevance of using the concept of the convex hull of the training data in assessing machine learning generalization, by emphasizing the difference between interpolated and extrapolated predictions. Besides several predictable correlations, we observe unexpectedly weak associations between the generalization ability of machine learning models and all metrics related to dimensionality, thus challenging the common assumption that the \\textit{curse of dimensionality} might impair generalization in machine learning.",

In this work, we close this substantial gap and contribute a qualitative study focusing on developers' mental models of the machine learning pipeline and potentially vulnerable components. Similar studies have helped in other security fields to discover root causes or improve risk communication. Our study reveals two \\facets of practitioners' mental models of machine learning security. Firstly, practitioners often confuse machine learning security with threats and defences that are not directly related to machine learning. Secondly, in contrast to most academic research, our participants perceive security of machine learning as not solely related to individual models, but rather in the context of entire workflows that consist of multiple components. Jointly with our additional findings, these two facets provide a foundation to substantiate mental models for machine learning security and have implications for the integration of adversarial machine learning into corporate workflows, \\new{decreasing practitioners' reported uncertainty}, and appropriate regulatory frameworks for machine learning security.",

However within the life insurance industry, Machine Learning is not widely used in practice as over the past years statistical models have shown their efficiency for risk assessment. Thus insurers may face difficulties to assess the value of the artificial intelligence. Focusing on the modification of the life insurance industry over time highlights the stake of using Machine Learning for insurers and benefits that it can bring by unleashing data value. This paper reviews traditional actuarial methodologies for survival modeling and extends them with Machine Learning techniques. It points out differences with regular machine learning models and emphasizes importance of specific implementations to face censored data with machine learning models family. In complement to this article, a Python library has been developed. Different open-source Machine Learning algorithms have been adjusted to adapt the specificities of life insurance data, namely censoring and truncation. Such models can be easily applied from this SCOR library to accurately model life insurance risks.",

In the present survey, several promising avenues of research will be examined which focus on the combination of machine learning (ML) and domain decomposition methods (DDMs). The aim of this survey is to provide an overview of existing work within this field and to structure it into domain decomposition for machine learning and machine learning-enhanced domain decomposition, including: domain decomposition for classical machine learning, domain decomposition to accelerate the training of physics-aware neural networks, machine learning to enhance the convergence properties or computational efficiency of DDMs, and machine learning as a discretization method in a DDM for the solution of PDEs. In each of these fields, we summarize existing work and key advances within a common framework and, finally, disuss ongoing challenges and opportunities for future research.",

        "abstract": "What is it to interpret the outputs of an opaque machine learning model. One approach is to develop interpretable machine learning techniques. These techniques aim to show how machine learning models function by providing either model centric local or global explanations, which can be based on mechanistic interpretations revealing the inner working mechanisms of models or nonmechanistic approximations showing input feature output data relationships. In this paper, we draw on social philosophy to argue that interpreting machine learning outputs in certain normatively salient domains could require appealing to a third type of explanation that we call sociostructural explanation. The relevance of this explanation type is motivated by the fact that machine learning models are not isolated entities but are embedded within and shaped by social structures. Sociostructural explanations aim to illustrate how social structures contribute to and partially explain the outputs of machine learning models. We demonstrate the importance of sociostructural explanations by examining a racially biased healthcare allocation algorithm. Our proposal highlights the need for transparency beyond model interpretability, understanding the outputs of machine learning systems could require a broader analysis that extends beyond the understanding of the machine learning model itself.",

The relations we concern are algebraic operations, binary relations, and binary relations with composition that can be reasoned categorically. A machine learning system transformation between two systems is a map between the systems, which preserves the relations we concern. The system transformations given by quotient or clustering, representable functor, and Yoneda embedding are highlighted and discussed by machine learning examples. An adjunction between machine learning systems, a special machine learning system transformation loop, provides the optimal way of solving problems. Machine learning system transformations are linked and compared by their maps at 2-cell, natural transformations. New insights and structures can be obtained from universal properties and algebraic structures given by monads, which are generated from adjunctions.",

        "abstract": "Security vulnerabilities play a vital role in network security system. Fuzzing technology is widely used as a vulnerability discovery technology to reduce damage in advance. However, traditional fuzzing techniques have many challenges, such as how to mutate input seed files, how to increase code coverage, and how to effectively bypass verification. Machine learning technology has been introduced as a new method into fuzzing test to alleviate these challenges. This paper reviews the research progress of using machine learning technology for fuzzing test in recent years, analyzes how machine learning improve the fuzz process and results, and sheds light on future work in fuzzing. Firstly, this paper discusses the reasons why machine learning techniques can be used for fuzzing scenarios and identifies six different stages in which machine learning have been used. Then this paper systematically study the machine learning based fuzzing models from selection of machine learning algorithm, pre-processing methods, datasets, evaluation metrics, and hyperparameters setting. Next, this paper assesses the performance of the machine learning models based on the frequently used evaluation metrics. The results of the evaluation prove that machine learning technology has an acceptable capability of categorize predictive for fuzzing. Finally, the comparison on capability of discovering vulnerabilities between traditional fuzzing tools and machine learning based fuzzing tools is analyzed. The results depict that the introduction of machine learning technology can improve the performance of fuzzing. However, there are still some limitations, such as unbalanced training samples and difficult to extract the characteristics related to vulnerabilities.",

In this study, we attempted to align two experiments in order to (1) make a hypothesis for machine and (2) empirically confirm the effect of active learning on learning. In Experiment 1, we compared the effect of a passive form of learning to active form of learning. The results showed that active learning had a greater learning outcomes than passive learning. In the machine experiment based on the human result, we imitated the human active learning as a form of knowledge distillation. The active learning framework performed better than the passive learning framework. In the end, we showed not only that we can make build better machine training framework through the human experiment result, but also empirically confirm the result of human experiment through imitated machine experiments; human-like active learning have crucial effect on learning performance.",

        "abstract": "We introduce Matched Machine Learning, a framework that combines the flexibility of machine learning black boxes with the interpretability of matching, a longstanding tool in observational causal inference. Interpretability is paramount in many high-stakes application of causal inference. Current tools for nonparametric estimation of both average and individualized treatment effects are black-boxes that do not allow for human auditing of estimates. Our framework uses machine learning to learn an optimal metric for matching units and estimating outcomes, thus achieving the performance of machine learning black-boxes, while being interpretable. Our general framework encompasses several published works as special cases. We provide asymptotic inference theory for our proposed framework, enabling users to construct approximate confidence intervals around estimates of both individualized and average treatment effects. We show empirically that instances of Matched Machine Learning perform on par with black-box machine learning methods and better than existing matching methods for similar problems. Finally, in our application we show how Matched Machine Learning can be used to perform causal inference even when covariate data are highly complex: we study an image dataset, and produce high quality matches and estimates of treatment effects.",

This is only enhanced by recent successes in the field of classical machine learning. In this work we propose an approach for the systematic treatment of machine learning, from the perspective of quantum information. Our approach is general and covers all three main branches of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. While quantum improvements in supervised and unsupervised learning have been reported, reinforcement learning has received much less attention. Within our approach, we tackle the problem of quantum enhancements in reinforcement learning as well, and propose a systematic scheme for providing improvements. As an example, we show that quadratic improvements in learning efficiency, and exponential improvements in performance over limited time periods, can be obtained for a broad class of learning problems.",

        "abstract": "Given the recent successes of Deep Learning in AI there has been increased interest in the role and need for explanations in machine learned theories. A distinct notion in this context is that of Michie's definition of Ultra-Strong Machine Learning (USML). USML is demonstrated by a measurable increase in human performance of a task following provision to the human of a symbolic machine learned theory for task performance. A recent paper demonstrates the beneficial effect of a machine learned logic theory for a classification task, yet no existing work to our knowledge has examined the potential harmfulness of machine's involvement for human comprehension during learning. This paper investigates the explanatory effects of a machine learned theory in the context of simple two person games and proposes a framework for identifying the harmfulness of machine explanations based on the Cognitive Science literature. The approach involves a cognitive window consisting of two quantifiable bounds and it is supported by empirical evidence collected from human trials. Our quantitative and qualitative results indicate that human learning aided by a symbolic machine learned theory which satisfies a cognitive window has achieved significantly higher performance than human self learning. Results also demonstrate that human learning aided by a symbolic machine learned theory that fails to satisfy this window leads to significantly worse performance than unaided human learning.",

However, significant barriers exist in crossing disciplinary boundaries when most machine learning tools are developed in different areas separately. We present Pykale - a Python library for knowledge-aware machine learning on graphs, images, texts, and videos to enable and accelerate interdisciplinary research. We formulate new green machine learning guidelines based on standard software engineering practices and propose a novel pipeline-based application programming interface (API). PyKale focuses on leveraging knowledge from multiple sources for accurate and interpretable prediction, thus supporting multimodal learning and transfer learning (particularly domain adaptation) with latest deep learning and dimensionality reduction models. We build PyKale on PyTorch and leverage the rich PyTorch ecosystem. Our pipeline-based API design enforces standardization and minimalism, embracing green machine learning concepts via reducing repetitions and redundancy, reusing existing resources, and recycling learning models across areas. We demonstrate its interdisciplinary nature via examples in bioinformatics, knowledge graph, image/video recognition, and medical imaging.",

        "abstract": "Is all of machine learning supervised to some degree? The field of machine learning has traditionally been categorized pedagogically into $supervised~vs~unsupervised~learning$; where supervised learning has typically referred to learning from labeled data, while unsupervised learning has typically referred to learning from unlabeled data. In this paper, we assert that all machine learning is in fact supervised to some degree, and that the scope of supervision is necessarily commensurate to the scope of learning potential. In particular, we argue that clustering algorithms such as k-means, and dimensionality reduction algorithms such as principal component analysis, variational autoencoders, and deep belief networks are each internally supervised by the data itself to learn their respective representations of its features. Furthermore, these algorithms are not capable of external inference until their respective outputs (clusters, principal components, or representation codes) have been identified and externally labeled in effect. As such, they do not suffice as examples of unsupervised learning. We propose that the categorization `supervised vs unsupervised learning' be dispensed with, and instead, learning algorithms be categorized as either $internally~or~externally~supervised$ (or both). We believe this change in perspective will yield new fundamental insights into the structure and character of data and of learning algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Since 2006, deep learning (DL) has become a rapidly growing research direction, redefining state-of-the-art performances in a wide range of areas such as object recognition, image segmentation, speech recognition and machine translation. In modern manufacturing systems, data-driven machine health monitoring is gaining in popularity due to the widespread deployment of low-cost sensors and their connection to the Internet. Meanwhile, deep learning provides useful tools for processing and analyzing these big machinery data. The main purpose of this paper is to review and summarize the emerging research work of deep learning on machine health monitoring. After the brief introduction of deep learning techniques, the applications of deep learning in machine health monitoring systems are reviewed mainly from the following aspects: Auto-encoder (AE) and its variants, Restricted Boltzmann Machines and its variants including Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Finally, some new trends of DL-based machine health monitoring methods are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning methods have achieved good performance and been widely applied in various real-world applications. They can learn the model adaptively and be better fit for special requirements of different tasks. Generally, a good machine learning system is composed of plentiful training data, a good model training process, and an accurate inference. Many factors can affect the performance of the machine learning process, among which the diversity of the machine learning process is an important one. The diversity can help each procedure to guarantee a total good machine learning: diversity of the training data ensures that the training data can provide more discriminative information for the model, diversity of the learned model (diversity in parameters of each model or diversity among different base models) makes each parameter/model capture unique or complement information and the diversity in inference can provide multiple choices each of which corresponds to a specific plausible local optimal result. Even though the diversity plays an important role in machine learning process, there is no systematical analysis of the diversification in machine learning system. In this paper, we systematically summarize the methods to make data diversification, model diversification, and inference diversification in the machine learning process, respectively. In addition, the typical applications where the diversity technology improved the machine learning performance have been surveyed, including the remote sensing imaging tasks, machine translation, camera relocalization, image segmentation, object detection, topic modeling, and others. Finally, we discuss some challenges of the diversity technology in machine learning and point out some directions in future work.",

        "abstract": "Fatal accidents are a major issue hindering the wide acceptance of safety-critical systems that employ machine learning and deep learning models, such as automated driving vehicles. In order to use machine learning in a safety-critical system, it is necessary to demonstrate the safety and security of the system through engineering processes. However, thus far, no such widely accepted engineering concepts or frameworks have been established for these systems. The key to using a machine learning model in a deductively engineered system is decomposing the data-driven training of machine learning models into requirement, design, and verification, particularly for machine learning models used in safety-critical systems. Simultaneously, open problems and relevant technical fields are not organized in a manner that enables researchers to select a theme and work on it. In this study, we identify, classify, and explore the open problems in engineering (safety-critical) machine learning systems --- that is, in terms of requirement, design, and verification of machine learning models and systems --- as well as discuss related works and research directions, using automated driving vehicles as an example. Our results show that machine learning models are characterized by a lack of requirements specification, lack of design specification, lack of interpretability, and lack of robustness. We also perform a gap analysis on a conventional system quality standard SQuARE with the characteristics of machine learning models to study quality models for machine learning systems. We find that a lack of requirements specification and lack of robustness have the greatest impact on conventional quality models.",

        "abstract": "Graph machine learning has been extensively studied in both academic and industry. However, as the literature on graph learning booms with a vast number of emerging methods and techniques, it becomes increasingly difficult to manually design the optimal machine learning algorithm for different graph-related tasks. To tackle the challenge, automated graph machine learning, which aims at discovering the best hyper-parameter and neural architecture configuration for different graph tasks/data without manual design, is gaining an increasing number of attentions from the research community. In this paper, we extensively discuss automated graph machine learning approaches, covering hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) and neural architecture search (NAS) for graph machine learning. We briefly overview existing libraries designed for either graph machine learning or automated machine learning respectively, and further in depth introduce AutoGL, our dedicated and the world's first open-source library for automated graph machine learning. Also, we describe a tailored benchmark that supports unified, reproducible, and efficient evaluations. Last but not least, we share our insights on future research directions for automated graph machine learning. This paper is the first systematic and comprehensive discussion of approaches, libraries as well as directions for automated graph machine learning.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning is usually defined in behaviourist terms, where external validation is the primary mechanism of learning. In this paper, I argue for a more holistic interpretation in which finding more probable, efficient and abstract representations is as central to learning as performance. In other words, machine learning should be extended with strategies to reason over its own learning process, leading to so-called meta-cognitive machine learning. As such, the de facto definition of machine learning should be reformulated in these intrinsically multi-objective terms, taking into account not only the task performance but also internal learning objectives. To this end, we suggest a \"model entropy function\" to be defined that quantifies the efficiency of the internal learning processes. It is conjured that the minimization of this model entropy leads to concept formation. Besides philosophical aspects, some initial illustrations are included to support the claims.",

        "abstract": "Despite the recent success of deep transfer learning approaches in NLP, there is a lack of quantitative studies demonstrating the gains these models offer in low-shot text classification tasks over existing paradigms. Deep transfer learning approaches such as BERT and ULMFiT demonstrate that they can beat state-of-the-art results on larger datasets, however when one has only 100-1000 labelled examples per class, the choice of approach is less clear, with classical machine learning and deep transfer learning representing valid options. This paper compares the current best transfer learning approach with top classical machine learning approaches on a trinary sentiment classification task to assess the best paradigm. We find that BERT, representing the best of deep transfer learning, is the best performing approach, outperforming top classical machine learning algorithms by 9.7% on average when trained with 100 examples per class, narrowing to 1.8% at 1000 labels per class. We also show the robustness of deep transfer learning in moving across domains, where the maximum loss in accuracy is only 0.7% in similar domain tasks and 3.2% cross domain, compared to classical machine learning which loses up to 20.6%.",

This behavior should be avoided in many decision support applications, where mistakes can have severe consequences. Albeit already studied in 1970, machine learning with rejection recently gained interest. This machine learning subfield enables machine learning models to abstain from making a prediction when likely to make a mistake.   This survey aims to provide an overview on machine learning with rejection. We introduce the conditions leading to two types of rejection, ambiguity and novelty rejection, which we carefully formalize. Moreover, we review and categorize strategies to evaluate a model's predictive and rejective quality. Additionally, we define the existing architectures for models with rejection and describe the standard techniques for learning such models. Finally, we provide examples of relevant application domains and show how machine learning with rejection relates to other machine learning research areas.",

In this paper, we show that by merging machine learning techniques with PSL monitors, we can extend PSL to work on continuous domains. We apply this technique in machine learning-based anomaly detection to analyze scenarios of real-time streaming events from continuous variables in order to detect abnormal behaviors of a system. By using machine learning with formal models, we leverage the strengths of both machine learning methods and formal semantics of time. On one hand, machine learning techniques can produce distributions on continuous variables, where abnormalities can be captured as deviations from the distributions. On the other hand, formal methods can characterize discrete temporal behaviors and relations that cannot be easily learned by machine learning techniques. Interestingly, the anomalies detected by machine learning and the underlying time representation used are discrete events. We implemented a temporal monitoring package (TEF) that operates in conjunction with normal data science packages for anomaly detection machine learning systems, and we show that TEF can be used to perform accurate interpretation of temporal correlation between events.",

This also means that the current practice of workforce training using machine learning tools, which requires low-level statistical and algorithmic details, is a barrier that needs to be addressed. Similar to data management languages such as SQL, machine learning needs to be practiced at a conceptual level to help make it a staple tool for general users. In particular, the technical sophistication demanded by existing machine learning frameworks is prohibitive for many scientists who are not computationally savvy or well versed in machine learning techniques. The learning curve to use the needed machine learning tools is also too high for them to take advantage of these powerful platforms to rapidly advance science. In this paper, we introduce a new declarative machine learning query language, called {\\em MQL}, for naive users. We discuss its merit and possible ways of implementing it over a traditional relational database system. We discuss two materials science experiments implemented using MQL on a materials science workflow system called MatFlow.",

In deriving MASS Learning, we also introduce Conserved Differential Information (CDI), an information-theoretic quantity that - unlike standard mutual information - can be usefully applied to deterministically-dependent continuous random variables like the input and output of a deep network. In a series of experiments, we show that deep networks trained with MASS Learning achieve competitive performance on supervised learning and uncertainty quantification benchmarks.",

In this paper, we introduce sustainable machine learning in federated learning settings, using rechargeable devices that can collect energy from the ambient environment. We propose a practical federated learning framework that leverages intermittent energy arrivals for training, with provable convergence guarantees. Our framework can be applied to a wide range of machine learning settings in networked environments, including distributed and federated learning in wireless and edge networks. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can provide significant performance improvement over the benchmark energy-agnostic federated learning settings.",

Additionally, we introduce an ART-integrated-aggregating machine that produces a single final model when multiple candidate algorithms are considered. We demonstrate the promising performance of ART through extensive empirical studies on regression, classification, and sparse learning.

As machine learning begins to permeate daily life, interpretable models may serve as a bridge between domain-expert authors and non-expert users.",

To achieve human level intelligence, learning machines need the guidance of a model of reality, similar to the ones used in causal inference tasks. To demonstrate the essential role of such models, I will present a summary of seven tasks which are beyond reach of current machine learning systems and which have been accomplished using the tools of causal modeling.",

In this paper, we show that the cross-validation risk is differentiable with respect to the hyperparameters and training data for many common machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, elastic-net regression, and support vector machines. Leveraging this property of differentiability, we propose a cross-validation gradient method (CVGM) for hyperparameter optimization. Our method enables efficient optimization in high-dimensional hyperparameter spaces of the cross-validation risk, the best surrogate of the true generalization ability of our learning algorithm.",

However, most of them cannot be put into production due to their slow training and inference speed caused by the heavy cost of homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation(MPC) methods. To circumvent this, I proposed a privacy definition which is suitable for large amount of data in machine learning tasks. Based on that, I showed that random transformations like linear transformation and random permutation can well protect privacy. Merging random transformations and arithmetic sharing together, I designed a framework for private machine learning with high efficiency and low computation cost.",

We give an axiomatisation for these circuits and prove a functional completeness result. Finally, we discuss the use of polynomial circuits over specific semirings to perform machine learning with discrete values.",

Stacking combines multiple supervised machine learners -- the \"base\" or \"level-0\" learners -- into a single learner. The currently supported base learners include regularized regression, random forest, gradient boosted trees, support vector machines, and feed-forward neural nets (multi-layer perceptron). pystacked can also be used with as a `regular' machine learning program to fit a single base learner and, thus, provides an easy-to-use API for scikit-learn's machine learning algorithms.",

However, implementing a machine learning model is not yet a trivial task and may seem intimidating to ecologists with no previous experience in this area. Here we provide a series of tips to help ecologists in implementing machine learning models. We focus on classification problems as many ecological studies aim to assign data into predefined classes such as ecological states or biological entities. Each of the nine tips identifies a common error, trap or challenge in developing machine learning models and provides recommendations to facilitate their use in ecological studies.",

Machine learning methods can have difficulties with high-cardinality variables. In this article, we empirically compare several versions of two of the most successful machine learning methods, tree-boosting and deep neural networks, and linear mixed effects models using multiple tabular data sets with high-cardinality categorical variables. We find that, first, machine learning models with random effects have higher prediction accuracy than their classical counterparts without random effects, and, second, tree-boosting with random effects outperforms deep neural networks with random effects.",

Here, recent progress in applying machine learning to improve the accuracy of density functional and related approximations is reviewed.

As machine learning models become more complicated, this pipeline becomes more difficult to manage effectively. In the physical sciences, there is an ever-increasing pool of metadata that is generated by the scientific research cycle. Tracking this metadata can reduce redundant work, improve reproducibility, and aid in the feature and training dataset engineering process. In this case study, we present a tool for machine learning metadata management in dynamic radiography. We evaluate the efficacy of this tool against the initial research workflow and discuss extensions to general machine learning pipelines in the physical sciences.",

A theoretic framework to synthetically generate process curves in a controlled way is introduced in order to benchmark machine learning algorithms for process drift detection. An evaluation score, called the temporal area under the curve, is introduced, which allows to quantify how well machine learning models unveil curves belonging to drift segments. Finally, a benchmark study comparing popular machine learning approaches on synthetic data generated with the introduced framework is presented that shows that existing algorithms often struggle with datasets containing multiple drift segments.",

Machine learning has become an increasingly important tool for analyzing and understanding the large-scale flood of data in astronomy. To take advantage of these tools, datasets are required for training and testing. However, building machine learning datasets for astronomy can be challenging. Astronomical data is collected from instruments built to explore science questions in a traditional fashion rather than to conduct machine learning. Thus, it is often the case that raw data, or even downstream processed data is not in a form amenable to machine learning. We explore the construction of machine learning datasets and we ask: what elements define effective machine learning datasets? We define effective machine learning datasets in astronomy to be formed with well-defined data points, structure, and metadata. We discuss why these elements are important for astronomical applications and ways to put them in practice. We posit that these qualities not only make the data suitable for machine learning, they also help to foster usable, reusable, and replicable science practices.",

Recent advances in secure and privacy-preserving computation, including trusted hardware enclaves and differential privacy, offer a way for mutually distrusting parties to efficiently train a machine learning model without revealing the training data. In this work, we introduce Myelin, a deep learning framework which combines these privacy-preservation primitives, and use it to establish a baseline level of performance for fully private machine learning.",

In this work, we propose the quantum-classical hybrid tensor networks (HTN) which combine tensor networks with classical neural networks in a uniform deep learning framework to overcome the limitations of regular tensor networks in machine learning. We first analyze the limitations of regular tensor networks in the applications of machine learning involving the representation power and architecture scalability. We conclude that in fact the regular tensor networks are not competent to be the basic building blocks of deep learning. Then, we discuss the performance of HTN which overcome all the deficiency of regular tensor networks for machine learning. In this sense, we are able to train HTN in the deep learning way which is the standard combination of algorithms such as Back Propagation and Stochastic Gradient Descent. We finally provide two applicable cases to show the potential applications of HTN, including quantum states classification and quantum-classical autoencoder. These cases also demonstrate the great potentiality to design various HTN in deep learning way.",

        "title": "A Review on Machine Unlearning",
        "abstract": "Recently, an increasing number of laws have governed the useability of users' privacy. For example, Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the right to be forgotten, requires machine learning applications to remove a portion of data from a dataset and retrain it if the user makes such a request. Furthermore, from the security perspective, training data for machine learning models, i.e., data that may contain user privacy, should be effectively protected, including appropriate erasure. Therefore, researchers propose various privacy-preserving methods to deal with such issues as machine unlearning. This paper provides an in-depth review of the security and privacy concerns in machine learning models. First, we present how machine learning can use users' private data in daily life and the role that the GDPR plays in this problem. Then, we introduce the concept of machine unlearning by describing the security threats in machine learning models and how to protect users' privacy from being violated using machine learning platforms. As the core content of the paper, we introduce and analyze current machine unlearning approaches and several representative research results and discuss them in the context of the data lineage. Furthermore, we also discuss the future research challenges in this field.",

We also present the novel continual learning method of incremental learning, where a challenging environment is solved using optimal weight initialization learned from first solving a similar easier environment. We show that incremental learning can produce vastly superior results than standard methods by providing a strong baseline method across ten Dex environments. We finally develop a saliency method for qualitative analysis of reinforcement learning, which shows the impact incremental learning has on network attention.",

This robopsychological approach raises some fundamental theoretical questions of machine learning. Our discussion of these questions is constrained to Turing machines. Alan Turing had given an algorithm (aka the Turing Machine) to describe algorithms. If it has been applied to describe itself then this brings us to Turing's notion of the universal machine. In the present paper, we investigate algorithms to write algorithms. From a pedagogy point of view, this way of writing programs can be considered as a combination of learning by listening and learning by doing due to it is based on applying agent technology and machine learning. As the main result we introduce the problem of learning and then we show that it cannot easily be handled in reality therefore it is reasonable to use machine learning algorithm for learning Turing machines.",

        "abstract": "Understanding why machine learning models behave the way they do empowers both system designers and end-users in many ways: in model selection, feature engineering, in order to trust and act upon the predictions, and in more intuitive user interfaces. Thus, interpretability has become a vital concern in machine learning, and work in the area of interpretable models has found renewed interest. In some applications, such models are as accurate as non-interpretable ones, and thus are preferred for their transparency. Even when they are not accurate, they may still be preferred when interpretability is of paramount importance. However, restricting machine learning to interpretable models is often a severe limitation. In this paper we argue for explaining machine learning predictions using model-agnostic approaches. By treating the machine learning models as black-box functions, these approaches provide crucial flexibility in the choice of models, explanations, and representations, improving debugging, comparison, and interfaces for a variety of users and models. We also outline the main challenges for such methods, and review a recently-introduced model-agnostic explanation approach (LIME) that addresses these challenges.",

For example, existing machine learning processes cannot address how to define business use cases for an AI application, how to convert business requirements from offering managers into data requirements for data scientists, and how to continuously improve AI applications in term of accuracy and fairness, and how to customize general purpose machine learning models with industry, domain, and use case specific data to make them more accurate for specific situations etc. Making AI work for enterprises requires special considerations, tools, methods and processes. In this paper we present a maturity framework for machine learning model lifecycle management for enterprises. Our framework is a re-interpretation of the software Capability Maturity Model (CMM) for machine learning model development process. We present a set of best practices from our personal experience of building large scale real-world machine learning models to help organizations achieve higher levels of maturity independent of their starting point.",

Recent advances in machine learning have the potential to recognize and classify complex patterns from different radiological imaging modalities such as x-rays, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography imaging. In many applications, machine learning based systems have shown comparable performance to human decision-making. The applications of machine learning are the key ingredients of future clinical decision making and monitoring systems. This review covers the fundamental concepts behind various machine learning techniques and their applications in several radiological imaging areas, such as medical image segmentation, brain function studies and neurological disease diagnosis, as well as computer-aided systems, image registration, and content-based image retrieval systems. Synchronistically, we will briefly discuss current challenges and future directions regarding the application of machine learning in radiological imaging. By giving insight on how take advantage of machine learning powered applications, we expect that clinicians can prevent and diagnose diseases more accurately and efficiently.",

We discuss desired properties for these machine learning markets in terms of fair revenue distribution and potential threats, including data replication. We then instantiate a collaborative market for cases where parties share a common machine learning task and where parties' tasks are different. Our marketplace incentivizes parties to submit high quality training and true validation data. To this end, we introduce a novel payment division function that is robust-to-replication and customized output models that perform well only on requested machine learning tasks. In experiments, we validate the assumptions underlying our theoretical analysis and show that these are approximately satisfied for commonly used machine learning models.",

This question was initially answered in 2007 by doing a qualitative survey among distinguished researchers. In our study, we revisit this question from a quantitative perspective. Concretely, we collect 54K abstracts of papers published between 2007 and 2016 in leading machine learning journals and conferences. We then use machine learning in order to determine the top 10 topics in machine learning. We not only include models, but provide a holistic view across optimization, data, features, etc. This quantitative approach allows reducing the bias of surveys. It reveals new and up-to-date insights into what the 10 most prolific topics in machine learning research are. This allows researchers to identify popular topics as well as new and rising topics for their research.",

It can be easily extended and specialized and it is also mapped to other more domain-specific ontologies developed in the area of machine learning and data mining. In this paper we overview existing state-of-the-art machine learning interchange formats and present the first release of ML-Schema, a canonical format resulted of more than seven years of experience among different research institutions. We argue that exposing semantics of machine learning algorithms, models, and experiments through a canonical format may pave the way to better interpretability and to realistically achieve the full interoperability of experiments regardless of platform or adopted workflow solution.",

Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) mainly refers to the automated methods for model selection and hyper-parameter optimization of various algorithms such as random forests, gradient boosting, neural networks, etc. In this paper, we introduce a new package i.e. DriveML for automated machine learning. DriveML helps in implementing some of the pillars of an automated machine learning pipeline such as automated data preparation, feature engineering, model building and model explanation by running the function instead of writing lengthy R codes. The DriveML package is available in CRAN. We compare the DriveML package with other relevant packages in CRAN/Github and find that DriveML performs the best across different parameters. We also provide an illustration by applying the DriveML package with default configuration on a real world dataset. Overall, the main benefits of DriveML are in development time savings, reduce developer's errors, optimal tuning of machine learning models and reproducibility.",

        "abstract": "Condition-based maintenance (CBM) strategies exploit machine learning models to assess the health status of systems based on the collected data from the physical environment, while machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. A malicious adversary can manipulate the collected data to deceive the machine learning model and affect the CBM system's performance. Adversarial machine learning techniques introduced in the computer vision domain can be used to make stealthy attacks on CBM systems by adding perturbation to data to confuse trained models. The stealthy nature causes difficulty and delay in detection of the attacks. In this paper, adversarial machine learning in the domain of CBM is introduced. A case study shows how adversarial machine learning can be used to attack CBM capabilities. Adversarial samples are crafted using the Fast Gradient Sign method, and the performance of a CBM system under attack is investigated. The obtained results reveal that CBM systems are vulnerable to adversarial machine learning attacks and defense strategies need to be considered.",

        "abstract": "This paper demonstrates the systematic use of combinatorial coverage for selecting and characterizing test and training sets for machine learning models. The presented work adapts combinatorial interaction testing, which has been successfully leveraged in identifying faults in software testing, to characterize data used in machine learning. The MNIST hand-written digits data is used to demonstrate that combinatorial coverage can be used to select test sets that stress machine learning model performance, to select training sets that lead to robust model performance, and to select data for fine-tuning models to new domains. Thus, the results posit combinatorial coverage as a holistic approach to training and testing for machine learning. In contrast to prior work which has focused on the use of coverage in regard to the internal of neural networks, this paper considers coverage over simple features derived from inputs and outputs. Thus, this paper addresses the case where the supplier of test and training sets for machine learning models does not have intellectual property rights to the models themselves. Finally, the paper addresses prior criticism of combinatorial coverage and provides a rebuttal which advocates the use of coverage metrics in machine learning applications.",

This has opened up many exciting new possibilities, not just in traditional areas of artificial intelligence, but also in scientific computing and computational science. At the same time, machine learning has also acquired the reputation of being a set of \"black box\" type of tricks, without fundamental principles. This has been a real obstacle for making further progress in machine learning. In this article, we try to address the following two very important questions: (1) How machine learning has already impacted and will further impact computational mathematics, scientific computing and computational science? (2) How computational mathematics, particularly numerical analysis, {can} impact machine learning? We describe some of the most important progress that has been made on these issues. Our hope is to put things into a perspective that will help to integrate machine learning with computational mathematics.",

Machine learning algorithms have been developed for certain data environments which substantially differ from the one we encounter in finance. Not only do difficulties arise due to some of the idiosyncrasies of financial markets, there is a fundamental tension between the underlying paradigm of machine learning and the research philosophy in financial economics. Given the peculiar features of financial markets and the empirical framework within social science, various adjustments have to be made to the conventional machine learning methodology. We discuss some of the main challenges of machine learning in finance and examine how these could be accounted for. Despite some of the challenges, we argue that machine learning could be unified with financial research to become a robust complement to the econometrician's toolbox. Moreover, we discuss the various applications of machine learning in the research process such as estimation, empirical discovery, testing, causal inference and prediction.",

We will explore the ways in which machine learning could benefit from new quantum technologies and algorithms to find new ways to speed up their computations by breakthroughs in physical hardware, as well as to improve existing models or devise new learning schemes in the quantum domain. Moreover, there are lots of experiments in quantum physics that do generate incredible amounts of data and machine learning would be a great tool to analyze those and make predictions, or even control the experiment itself. On top of that, data visualization techniques and other schemes borrowed from machine learning can be of great use to theoreticians to have better intuition on the structure of complex manifolds or to make predictions on theoretical models. This new research field, named as Quantum Machine Learning, is very rapidly growing since it is expected to provide huge advantages over its classical counterpart and deeper investigations are timely needed since they can be already tested on the already commercially available quantum machines.",

Unfortunately, machine learning has also shown to be susceptible to deception, leading to errors, and even fatal failures.

Software verification and testing are established technique for assuring such properties, for example by detecting errors. However, software testing challenges for machine learning are vast and profuse - yet critical to address. This summary talk discusses the current state-of-the-art of software testing for machine learning. More specifically, it discusses six key challenge areas for software testing of machine learning systems, examines current approaches to these challenges and highlights their limitations.

        "title": "Analysis of Software Engineering for Agile Machine Learning Projects",
        "abstract": "The number of machine learning, artificial intelligence or data science related software engineering projects using Agile methodology is increasing. However, there are very few studies on how such projects work in practice. In this paper, we analyze project issues tracking data taken from Scrum (a popular tool for Agile) for several machine learning projects. We compare this data with corresponding data from non-machine learning projects, in an attempt to analyze how machine learning projects are executed differently from normal software engineering projects. On analysis, we find that machine learning project issues use different kinds of words to describe issues, have higher number of exploratory or research oriented tasks as compared to implementation tasks, and have a higher number of issues in the product backlog after each sprint, denoting that it is more difficult to estimate the duration of machine learning project related tasks in advance. After analyzing this data, we propose a few ways in which Agile machine learning projects can be better logged and executed, given their differences with normal software engineering projects.",

However, many issues need to be addressed before this becomes a reality. This article focuses on one particular issue of broad interest: How can we integrate machine learning with physics-based modeling to develop new interpretable and truly reliable physical models? After introducing the general guidelines, we discuss the two most important issues for developing machine learning-based physical models: Imposing physical constraints and obtaining optimal datasets. We also provide a simple and intuitive explanation for the fundamental reasons behind the success of modern machine learning, as well as an introduction to the concurrent machine learning framework needed for integrating machine learning with physics-based modeling. Molecular dynamics and moment closure of kinetic equations are used as examples to illustrate the main issues discussed. We end with a general discussion on where this integration will lead us to, and where the new frontier will be after machine learning is successfully integrated into scientific modeling.",

For that we carry over the risk definition from decision theory to machine learning. We develop and implement a method that allows to define deployment scenarios, test the machine learning model under the conditions specified in each scenario, and estimate the damage associated with the output of the machine learning model under test. Using the likelihood of each scenario together with the estimated damage we define \\emph{key risk indicators} of a machine learning model.   The definition of scenarios and weighting by their likelihood allows for standardized risk assessment in machine learning throughout multiple domains of application. In particular, in our framework, the robustness of a machine learning model to random input corruptions, distributional shifts caused by a changing environment, and adversarial perturbations can be assessed.",

        "abstract": "Fair Machine Learning endeavors to prevent unfairness arising in the context of machine learning applications embedded in society. Despite the variety of definitions of fairness and proposed \"fair algorithms\", there remain unresolved conceptual problems regarding fairness. In this paper, we dissect the role of statistical independence in fairness and randomness notions regularly used in machine learning. Thereby, we are led to a suprising hypothesis: randomness and fairness can be considered equivalent concepts in machine learning.   In particular, we obtain a relativized notion of randomness expressed as statistical independence by appealing to Von Mises' century-old foundations for probability. This notion turns out to be \"orthogonal\" in an abstract sense to the commonly used i.i.d.-randomness. Using standard fairness notions in machine learning, which are defined via statistical independence, we then link the ex ante randomness assumptions about the data to the ex post requirements for fair predictions. This connection proves fruitful: we use it to argue that randomness and fairness are essentially relative and that both concepts should reflect their nature as modeling assumptions in machine learning.",

And in the development of machine learning systems, the most widely used are publicly available datasets. However, since the images in the publicly available dataset are mainly obtained from the Internet, some images are not commercially available. Furthermore, developers of machine learning systems do not often care about the license of the dataset when training machine learning models with it. In summary, the licensing of datasets for machine learning systems is in a state of incompleteness in all aspects at this stage.   Our investigation of two collection datasets revealed that most of the current datasets lacked licenses, and the lack of licenses made it impossible to determine the commercial availability of the datasets. Therefore, we decided to take a more scientific and systematic approach to investigate the licensing of datasets and the licensing of machine learning systems that use the dataset to make it easier and more compliant for future developers of machine learning systems.",

        "abstract": "After a surge in popularity of supervised Deep Learning, the desire to reduce the dependence on curated, labelled data sets and to leverage the vast quantities of unlabelled data available recently triggered renewed interest in unsupervised learning algorithms. Despite a significantly improved performance due to approaches such as the identification of disentangled latent representations, contrastive learning, and clustering optimisations, the performance of unsupervised machine learning still falls short of its hypothesised potential. Machine learning has previously taken inspiration from neuroscience and cognitive science with great success. However, this has mostly been based on adult learners with access to labels and a vast amount of prior knowledge. In order to push unsupervised machine learning forward, we argue that developmental science of infant cognition might hold the key to unlocking the next generation of unsupervised learning approaches. Conceptually, human infant learning is the closest biological parallel to artificial unsupervised learning, as infants too must learn useful representations from unlabelled data. In contrast to machine learning, these new representations are learned rapidly and from relatively few examples. Moreover, infants learn robust representations that can be used flexibly and efficiently in a number of different tasks and contexts. We identify five crucial factors enabling infants' quality and speed of learning, assess the extent to which these have already been exploited in machine learning, and propose how further adoption of these factors can give rise to previously unseen performance levels in unsupervised learning.",

        "abstract": "This article reviews meta-learning also known as learning-to-learn which seeks rapid and accurate model adaptation to unseen tasks with applications in highly automated AI, few-shot learning, natural language processing and robotics. Unlike deep learning, meta-learning can be applied to few-shot high-dimensional datasets and considers further improving model generalization to unseen tasks. Deep learning is focused upon in-sample prediction and meta-learning concerns model adaptation for out-of-sample prediction. Meta-learning can continually perform self-improvement to achieve highly autonomous AI. Meta-learning may serve as an additional generalization block complementary for original deep learning model. Meta-learning seeks adaptation of machine learning models to unseen tasks which are vastly different from trained tasks. Meta-learning with coevolution between agent and environment provides solutions for complex tasks unsolvable by training from scratch. Meta-learning methodology covers a wide range of great minds and thoughts. We briefly introduce meta-learning methodologies in the following categories: black-box meta-learning, metric-based meta-learning, layered meta-learning and Bayesian meta-learning framework. Recent applications concentrate upon the integration of meta-learning with other machine learning framework to provide feasible integrated problem solutions. We briefly present recent meta-learning advances and discuss potential future research directions.",

        "abstract": "There are two common approaches for optimizing the performance of a machine: genetic algorithms and machine learning. A genetic algorithm is applied over many generations whereas machine learning works by applying feedback until the system meets a performance threshold. Though these are methods that typically operate separately, we combine evolutionary adaptation and machine learning into one approach. Our focus is on machines that can learn during their lifetime, but instead of equipping them with a machine learning algorithm we aim to let them evolve their ability to learn by themselves. We use evolvable networks of probabilistic and deterministic logic gates, known as Markov Brains, as our computational model organism. The ability of Markov Brains to learn is augmented by a novel adaptive component that can change its computational behavior based on feedback. We show that Markov Brains can indeed evolve to incorporate these feedback gates to improve their adaptability to variable environments. By combining these two methods, we now also implemented a computational model that can be used to study the evolution of learning.",

It has been observed that such machine learning-based frameworks are providing satisfactory metal layer hotspot prediction results on known public metal layer benchmarks. In this work, we seek to evaluate how these machine learning-based hotspot detectors generalize to complicated patterns. We first introduce a automatic layout generation tool that can synthesize varies layout patterns given a set of design rules. The tool currently supports both metal layer and via layer generation. As a case study, we conduct hotspot detection on the generated via layer layouts with representative machine learning-based hotspot detectors, which shows that continuous study on model robustness and generality is necessary to prototype and integrate the learning engines in DFM flows.

It may permit, on the one hand, to carry out more efficient machine learning calculations by means of quantum devices, while, on the other hand, to employ machine learning techniques to better control quantum systems. Inside quantum machine learning, quantum reinforcement learning aims at developing \"intelligent\" quantum agents that may interact with the outer world and adapt to it, with the strategy of achieving some final goal. Another paradigm inside quantum machine learning is that of quantum autoencoders, which may allow one for employing fewer resources in a quantum device via a training process. Moreover, the field of quantum biomimetics aims at establishing analogies between biological and quantum systems, to look for previously inadvertent connections that may enable useful applications. Two recent examples are the concepts of quantum artificial life, as well as of quantum memristors. In this Perspective, we give an overview of these topics, describing the related research carried out by the scientific community.",

For example, VC dimension characterizes PAC learning, SQ dimension characterizes weak learning with statistical queries, and Littlestone dimension characterizes online learning.   In this paper we aim to develop combinatorial dimensions that characterize bounded memory learning. We propose a candidate solution for the case of realizable strong learning under a known distribution, based on the SQ dimension of neighboring distributions. We prove both upper and lower bounds for our candidate solution, that match in some regime of parameters. In this parameter regime there is an equivalence between bounded memory and SQ learning. We conjecture that our characterization holds in a much wider regime of parameters.",

        "abstract": "Relational logistic regression (RLR) is a representation of conditional probability in terms of weighted formulae for modelling multi-relational data. In this paper, we develop a learning algorithm for RLR models. Learning an RLR model from data consists of two steps: 1- learning the set of formulae to be used in the model (a.k.a. structure learning) and learning the weight of each formula (a.k.a. parameter learning). For structure learning, we deploy Schmidt and Murphy's hierarchical assumption: first we learn a model with simple formulae, then more complex formulae are added iteratively only if all their sub-formulae have proven effective in previous learned models. For parameter learning, we convert the problem into a non-relational learning problem and use an off-the-shelf logistic regression learning algorithm from Weka, an open-source machine learning tool, to learn the weights. We also indicate how hidden features about the individuals can be incorporated into RLR to boost the learning performance. We compare our learning algorithm to other structure and parameter learning algorithms in the literature, and compare the performance of RLR models to standard logistic regression and RDN-Boost on a modified version of the MovieLens data-set.",

        "abstract": "In [1, 2], we have explored the theoretical aspects of feature extraction optimization processes for solving largescale problems and overcoming machine learning limitations. Majority of optimization algorithms that have been introduced in [1, 2] guarantee the optimal performance of supervised learning, given offline and discrete data, to deal with curse of dimensionality (CoD) problem. These algorithms, however, are not tailored for solving emerging learning problems. One of the important issues caused by online data is lack of sufficient samples per class. Further, traditional machine learning algorithms cannot achieve accurate training based on limited distributed data, as data has proliferated and dispersed significantly. Machine learning employs a strict model or embedded engine to train and predict which still fails to learn unseen classes and sufficiently use online data. In this chapter, we introduce these challenges elaborately. We further investigate Meta-Learning (MTL) algorithm, and their application and promises to solve the emerging problems by answering how autonomous agents can learn to learn?.",

Machine learning algorithms build a model from sample data, called training data, to make predictions or judgments without being explicitly programmed to do so. A variety of wellknown machine learning algorithms have been developed for use in the field of computer science to analyze data. This paper introduced a new machine learning algorithm called impact learning. Impact learning is a supervised learning algorithm that can be consolidated in both classification and regression problems. It can furthermore manifest its superiority in analyzing competitive data. This algorithm is remarkable for learning from the competitive situation and the competition comes from the effects of autonomous features. It is prepared by the impacts of the highlights from the intrinsic rate of natural increase (RNI). We, moreover, manifest the prevalence of the impact learning over the conventional machine learning algorithm.",

        "abstract": "We review state-of-the-art formal methods applied to the emerging field of the verification of machine learning systems. Formal methods can provide rigorous correctness guarantees on hardware and software systems. Thanks to the availability of mature tools, their use is well established in the industry, and in particular to check safety-critical applications as they undergo a stringent certification process. As machine learning is becoming more popular, machine-learned components are now considered for inclusion in critical systems. This raises the question of their safety and their verification. Yet, established formal methods are limited to classic, i.e. non machine-learned software. Applying formal methods to verify systems that include machine learning has only been considered recently and poses novel challenges in soundness, precision, and scalability.   We first recall established formal methods and their current use in an exemplar safety-critical field, avionic software, with a focus on abstract interpretation based techniques as they provide a high level of scalability. This provides a golden standard and sets high expectations for machine learning verification. We then provide a comprehensive and detailed review of the formal methods developed so far for machine learning, highlighting their strengths and limitations. The large majority of them verify trained neural networks and employ either SMT, optimization, or abstract interpretation techniques. We also discuss methods for support vector machines and decision tree ensembles, as well as methods targeting training and data preparation, which are critical but often neglected aspects of machine learning. Finally, we offer perspectives for future research directions towards the formal verification of machine learning systems.",

        "title": "FLICU: A Federated Learning Workflow for Intensive Care Unit Mortality   Prediction",
        "abstract": "Although Machine Learning (ML) can be seen as a promising tool to improve clinical decision-making for supporting the improvement of medication plans, clinical procedures, diagnoses, or medication prescriptions, it remains limited by access to healthcare data. Healthcare data is sensitive, requiring strict privacy practices, and typically stored in data silos, making traditional machine learning challenging. Federated learning can counteract those limitations by training machine learning models over data silos while keeping the sensitive data localized. This study proposes a federated learning workflow for ICU mortality prediction. Hereby, the applicability of federated learning as an alternative to centralized machine learning and local machine learning is investigated by introducing federated learning to the binary classification problem of predicting ICU mortality. We extract multivariate time series data from the MIMIC-III database (lab values and vital signs), and benchmark the predictive performance of four deep sequential classifiers (FRNN, LSTM, GRU, and 1DCNN) varying the patient history window lengths (8h, 16h, 24h, 48h) and the number of FL clients (2, 4, 8). The experiments demonstrate that both centralized machine learning and federated learning are comparable in terms of AUPRC and F1-score. Furthermore, the federated approach shows superior performance over local machine learning. Thus, the federated approach can be seen as a valid and privacy-preserving alternative to centralized machine learning for classifying ICU mortality when sharing sensitive patient data between hospitals is not possible.",

However, due to model aggregation strategies, existing frameworks require strict model homogeneity, limiting the application in more complicated scenarios. Besides, the communication cost of FL's model and gradient transmission is extremely high. This paper proposes Loosely Coupled Federated Learning (LC-FL), a framework using generative models as transmission media to achieve low communication cost and heterogeneous federated learning. LC-FL can be applied on scenarios where clients possess different kinds of machine learning models. Experiments on real-world datasets covering different multiparty scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal.",

However, the deep learning algorithm improvement needs more and more data to be shared within research community. Methodologies like federated learning, differential privacy, additive secret sharing provides a way to train machine learning models on edge without moving the data from the edge. However, it is very computationally intensive and prone to adversarial attacks. Therefore, this work introduces a privacy preserving FedCollabNN framework for training machine learning models at edge, which is computationally efficient and robust against adversarial attacks.

We show, however, that deep networks learned by the standard gradient descent algorithm are in fact mathematically approximately equivalent to kernel machines, a learning method that simply memorizes the data and uses it directly for prediction via a similarity function (the kernel). This greatly enhances the interpretability of deep network weights, by elucidating that they are effectively a superposition of the training examples. The network architecture incorporates knowledge of the target function into the kernel. This improved understanding should lead to better learning algorithms.",

These OOD tasks require learning-to-learn from observations of the same (ODE) dynamical system with different unknown ODE parameters, and demand accurate forecasts even under out-of-support initial conditions and out-of-support ODE parameters. In this work we propose a solution for such tasks, which we define as a meta-learning procedure for causal structure discovery (including invariant risk minimization).

        "abstract": "Context: The software development industry is rapidly adopting machine learning for transitioning modern day software systems towards highly intelligent and self-learning systems. However, the full potential of machine learning for improving the software engineering life cycle itself is yet to be discovered, i.e., up to what extent machine learning can help reducing the effort/complexity of software engineering and improving the quality of resulting software systems. To date, no comprehensive study exists that explores the current state-of-the-art on the adoption of machine learning across software engineering life cycle stages. Objective: This article addresses the aforementioned problem and aims to present a state-of-the-art on the growing number of uses of machine learning in software engineering. Method: We conduct a systematic mapping study on applications of machine learning to software engineering following the standard guidelines and principles of empirical software engineering. Results: This study introduces a machine learning for software engineering (MLSE) taxonomy classifying the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques according to their applicability to various software engineering life cycle stages. Overall, 227 articles were rigorously selected and analyzed as a result of this study.

        "abstract": "Federated machine learning is growing fast in academia and industries as a solution to solve data hungriness and privacy issues in machine learning. Being a widely distributed system, federated machine learning requires various system design thinking. To better design a federated machine learning system, researchers have introduced multiple patterns and tactics that cover various system design aspects. However, the multitude of patterns leaves the designers confused about when and which pattern to adopt. In this paper, we present a set of decision models for the selection of patterns for federated machine learning architecture design based on a systematic literature review on federated machine learning, to assist designers and architects who have limited knowledge of federated machine learning. Each decision model maps functional and non-functional requirements of federated machine learning systems to a set of patterns. We also clarify the drawbacks of the patterns. We evaluated the decision models by mapping the decision patterns to concrete federated machine learning architectures by big tech firms to assess the models' correctness and usefulness. The evaluation results indicate that the proposed decision models are able to bring structure to the federated machine learning architecture design process and help explicitly articulate the design rationale.",

Such an approach offers a significant advantage in music scenarios in which musicians can teach the system to learn an idiosyncratic style, or can break the rules to explore the system's capacity in unexpected ways. In this chapter we draw on music, machine learning, and human-computer interaction to elucidate an understanding of machine learning algorithms as creative tools for music and the sonic arts. We motivate a new understanding of learning algorithms as human-computer interfaces. We show that, like other interfaces, learning algorithms can be characterised by the ways their affordances intersect with goals of human users. We also argue that the nature of interaction between users and algorithms impacts the usability and usefulness of those algorithms in profound ways. This human-centred view of machine learning motivates our concluding discussion of what it means to employ machine learning as a creative tool.",

MLaut provides a high-level workflow interface to machine algorithm algorithms, implements a local back-end to a database of dataset collections, trained algorithms, and experimental results, and provides easy-to-use interfaces to the scikit-learn and keras modelling libraries. Experiments are easy to set up with default settings in a few lines of code, while remaining fully customizable to the level of hyper-parameter tuning, pipeline composition, or deep learning architecture.   As a principal test case for MLaut, we conducted a large-scale supervised classification study in order to benchmark the performance of a number of machine learning algorithms - to our knowledge also the first larger-scale study on standard supervised learning data sets to include deep learning algorithms. While corroborating a number of previous findings in literature, we found (within the limitations of our study) that deep neural networks do not perform well on basic supervised learning, i.e., outside the more specialized, image-, audio-, or text-based tasks.",

In the third part, we present the links between stochastic gradient descent and mean-field theory. Conversely, in the fourth and fifth parts, we review machine learning approaches to stochastic control problems, and focus on the deterministic case, to explain, more easily, the numerical algorithms.",

        "abstract": "With the exploding popularity of machine learning, domain knowledge in various forms has been playing a crucial role in improving the learning performance, especially when training data is limited. Nonetheless, there is little understanding of to what extent domain knowledge can affect a machine learning task from a quantitative perspective. To increase the transparency and rigorously explain the role of domain knowledge in machine learning, we study the problem of quantifying the values of domain knowledge in terms of its contribution to the learning performance in the context of informed machine learning. We propose a quantification method based on Shapley value that fairly attributes the overall learning performance improvement to different domain knowledge. We also present Monte-Carlo sampling to approximate the fair value of domain knowledge with a polynomial time complexity. We run experiments of injecting symbolic domain knowledge into semi-supervised learning tasks on both MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, providing quantitative values of different symbolic knowledge and rigorously explaining how it affects the machine learning performance in terms of test accuracy.",
