        "abstract": "Machine learning technologies have demonstrated immense capabilities in various domains. They play a key role in the success of modern businesses. However, adoption of machine learning technologies has a lot of untouched potential. Cost of developing custom machine learning solutions that solve unique business problems is a major inhibitor to far-reaching adoption of machine learning technologies. We recognize that the monolithic nature prevalent in today's machine learning applications stands in the way of efficient and cost effective customized machine learning solution development. In this work we explore the benefits of modular machine learning solutions and discuss how modular machine learning solutions can overcome some of the major solution engineering limitations of monolithic machine learning solutions. We analyze the trade-offs between modular and monolithic machine learning solutions through three deep learning problems; one text based and the two image based. Our experimental results show that modular machine learning solutions have a promising potential to reap the solution engineering advantages of modularity while gaining performance and data advantages in a way the monolithic machine learning solutions do not permit.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the use of machine learning in meteorology has increased greatly. While many machine learning methods are not new, university classes on machine learning are largely unavailable to meteorology students and are not required to become a meteorologist. The lack of formal instruction has contributed to perception that machine learning methods are 'black boxes' and thus end-users are hesitant to apply the machine learning methods in their every day workflow. To reduce the opaqueness of machine learning methods and lower hesitancy towards machine learning in meteorology, this paper provides a survey of some of the most common machine learning methods. A familiar meteorological example is used to contextualize the machine learning methods while also discussing machine learning topics using plain language. The following machine learning methods are demonstrated: linear regression; logistic regression; decision trees; random forest; gradient boosted decision trees; naive Bayes; and support vector machines. Beyond discussing the different methods, the paper also contains discussions on the general machine learning process as well as best practices to enable readers to apply machine learning to their own datasets. Furthermore, all code (in the form of Jupyter notebooks and Google Colaboratory notebooks) used to make the examples in the paper is provided in an effort to catalyse the use of machine learning in meteorology.",

Machine learning clouds hold the promise of hiding all the sophistication of running large-scale machine learning: Instead of specifying how to run a machine learning task, users only specify what machine learning task to run and the cloud figures out the rest. Raising the level of abstraction, however, rarely comes free - a performance penalty is possible. How good, then, are current machine learning clouds on real-world machine learning workloads?   We study this question with a focus on binary classication problems. We present mlbench, a novel benchmark constructed by harvesting datasets from Kaggle competitions. We then compare the performance of the top winning code available from Kaggle with that of running machine learning clouds from both Azure and Amazon on mlbench. Our comparative study reveals the strength and weakness of existing machine learning clouds and points out potential future directions for improvement.",

Data is critical and penetrating in the whole machine learning pipelines. As machine learning pipelines involve many parties and, in order to be successful, have to form a constructive and dynamic eco-system, marketplaces and data pricing are fundamental in connecting and facilitating those many parties. In this article, we survey the principles and the latest research development of data pricing in machine learning pipelines. We start with a brief review of data marketplaces and pricing desiderata. Then, we focus on pricing in three important steps in machine learning pipelines. To understand pricing in the step of training data collection, we review pricing raw data sets and data labels. We also investigate pricing in the step of collaborative training of machine learning models, and overview pricing machine learning models for end users in the step of machine learning deployment. We also discuss a series of possible future directions.",

Also, the machine learning process is difficult to automate. This paper proposes building a trustable machine learning system by using blockchain technology, which can store data in a permanent and immutable way. In addition, smart contracts are used to automate the machine learning process. This paper makes three contributions. First, it establishes a link between machine learning technology and blockchain technology. Previously, machine learning and blockchain have been considered two independent technologies without an obvious link. Second, it proposes a unified analytical framework for trustable machine learning by using blockchain technology. This unified framework solves both the trustability and automation issues in machine learning. Third, it enables a computer to translate core machine learning implementation from a single thread on a single machine to multiple threads on multiple machines running with blockchain by using a unified approach. The paper uses association rule mining as an example to demonstrate how trustable machine learning can be implemented with blockchain, and it shows how this approach can be used to analyze opioid prescriptions to help combat the opioid crisis.",

        "abstract": "The newly emerged machine learning (e.g. deep learning) methods have become a strong driving force to revolutionize a wide range of industries, such as smart healthcare, financial technology, and surveillance systems. Meanwhile, privacy has emerged as a big concern in this machine learning-based artificial intelligence era. It is important to note that the problem of privacy preservation in the context of machine learning is quite different from that in traditional data privacy protection, as machine learning can act as both friend and foe. Currently, the work on the preservation of privacy and machine learning (ML) is still in an infancy stage, as most existing solutions only focus on privacy problems during the machine learning process. Therefore, a comprehensive study on the privacy preservation problems and machine learning is required. This paper surveys the state of the art in privacy issues and solutions for machine learning. The survey covers three categories of interactions between privacy and machine learning: (i) private machine learning, (ii) machine learning aided privacy protection, and (iii) machine learning-based privacy attack and corresponding protection schemes. The current research progress in each category is reviewed and the key challenges are identified. Finally, based on our in-depth analysis of the area of privacy and machine learning, we point out future research directions in this field.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning is an established and frequently used technique in industry and academia but a standard process model to improve success and efficiency of machine learning applications is still missing. Project organizations and machine learning practitioners have a need for guidance throughout the life cycle of a machine learning application to meet business expectations. We therefore propose a process model for the development of machine learning applications, that covers six phases from defining the scope to maintaining the deployed machine learning application. The first phase combines business and data understanding as data availability oftentimes affects the feasibility of the project. The sixth phase covers state-of-the-art approaches for monitoring and maintenance of a machine learning applications, as the risk of model degradation in a changing environment is eminent. With each task of the process, we propose quality assurance methodology that is suitable to adress challenges in machine learning development that we identify in form of risks. The methodology is drawn from practical experience and scientific literature and has proven to be general and stable. The process model expands on CRISP-DM, a data mining process model that enjoys strong industry support but lacks to address machine learning specific tasks. Our work proposes an industry and application neutral process model tailored for machine learning applications with focus on technical tasks for quality assurance.",

        "abstract": "We argue that insurance can act as an analogon for the social situatedness of machine learning systems, hence allowing machine learning scholars to take insights from the rich and interdisciplinary insurance literature. Tracing the interaction of uncertainty, fairness and responsibility in insurance provides a fresh perspective on fairness in machine learning. We link insurance fairness conceptions to their machine learning relatives, and use this bridge to problematize fairness as calibration. In this process, we bring to the forefront two themes that have been largely overlooked in the machine learning literature: responsibility and aggregate-individual tensions.",

Finally, this work provides some equivalences useful to prove and test stability in Machine Learning models. The results suggest that whenever stability is aligned with the notion of function smoothness, then the stability of Machine Learning models primarily depends upon certain topological, measurable properties of the classification sets within the ML model domain.",

We collect and distill statistics on the role of iteration within machine learning workflow development, and report preliminary trends and insights from our investigation, as a starting point towards this benchmark.

The Julia language is a fast, easy-to-use, and open-source programming language that was originally designed for high-performance computing, which can well balance the efficiency and simplicity. This paper summarizes the related research work and developments in the application of the Julia language in machine learning.

Then, it investigates applications of the machine learning algorithms implemented with the Julia language.

        "abstract": "The ethics of Machine Learning has become an unavoidable topic in the AI Community. The deployment of machine learning systems in multiple social contexts has resulted in a closer ethical scrutiny of the design, development, and application of these systems. The AI/ML community has come to terms with the imperative to think about the ethical implications of machine learning, not only as a product but also as a practice (Birhane, 2021; Shen et al. 2021). The critical question that is troubling many debates is what can constitute an ethically accountable machine learning system. In this paper we explore possibilities for ethical evaluation of machine learning methodologies. We scrutinize techniques, methods and technical practices in machine learning from a relational ethics perspective, taking into consideration how machine learning systems are part of the world and how they relate to different forms of agency. Taking a page from Phil Agre (1997) we use the notion of a critical technical practice as a means of analysis of machine learning approaches. Our radical proposal is that supervised learning appears to be the only machine learning method that is ethically defensible.",

        "abstract": "The term \"interpretability\" is oftenly used by machine learning researchers each with their own intuitive understanding of it. There is no universal well agreed upon definition of interpretability in machine learning. As any type of science discipline is mainly driven by the set of formulated questions rather than by different tools in that discipline, e.g. astrophysics is the discipline that learns the composition of stars, not as the discipline that use the spectroscopes. Similarly, we propose that machine learning interpretability should be a discipline that answers specific questions related to interpretability. These questions can be of statistical, causal and counterfactual nature. Therefore, there is a need to look into the interpretability problem of machine learning in the context of questions that need to be addressed rather than different tools. We discuss about a hypothetical interpretability framework driven by a question based scientific approach rather than some specific machine learning model. Using a question based notion of interpretability, we can step towards understanding the science of machine learning rather than its engineering. This notion will also help us understanding any specific problem more in depth rather than relying solely on machine learning methods.",

        "abstract": "As machine learning becomes more and more available to the general public, theoretical questions are turning into pressing practical issues. Possibly, one of the most relevant concerns is the assessment of our confidence in trusting machine learning predictions. In many real-world cases, it is of utmost importance to estimate the capabilities of a machine learning algorithm to generalize, i.e., to provide accurate predictions on unseen data, depending on the characteristics of the target problem. In this work, we perform a meta-analysis of 109 publicly-available classification data sets, modeling machine learning generalization as a function of a variety of data set characteristics, ranging from number of samples to intrinsic dimensionality, from class-wise feature skewness to $F1$ evaluated on test samples falling outside the convex hull of the training set. Experimental results demonstrate the relevance of using the concept of the convex hull of the training data in assessing machine learning generalization, by emphasizing the difference between interpolated and extrapolated predictions. Besides several predictable correlations, we observe unexpectedly weak associations between the generalization ability of machine learning models and all metrics related to dimensionality, thus challenging the common assumption that the \\textit{curse of dimensionality} might impair generalization in machine learning.",

Therefore, we comprehensively survey AutoML on graphs in this paper, primarily focusing on hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) and neural architecture search (NAS) for graph machine learning.

In this work, we close this substantial gap and contribute a qualitative study focusing on developers' mental models of the machine learning pipeline and potentially vulnerable components. Similar studies have helped in other security fields to discover root causes or improve risk communication. Our study reveals two \\facets of practitioners' mental models of machine learning security. Firstly, practitioners often confuse machine learning security with threats and defences that are not directly related to machine learning. Secondly, in contrast to most academic research, our participants perceive security of machine learning as not solely related to individual models, but rather in the context of entire workflows that consist of multiple components. Jointly with our additional findings, these two facets provide a foundation to substantiate mental models for machine learning security and have implications for the integration of adversarial machine learning into corporate workflows, \\new{decreasing practitioners' reported uncertainty}, and appropriate regulatory frameworks for machine learning security.",

Focusing on the modification of the life insurance industry over time highlights the stake of using Machine Learning for insurers and benefits that it can bring by unleashing data value. This paper reviews traditional actuarial methodologies for survival modeling and extends them with Machine Learning techniques. It points out differences with regular machine learning models and emphasizes importance of specific implementations to face censored data with machine learning models family.

Different open-source Machine Learning algorithms have been adjusted to adapt the specificities of life insurance data, namely censoring and truncation.

        "abstract": "What is it to interpret the outputs of an opaque machine learning model. One approach is to develop interpretable machine learning techniques. These techniques aim to show how machine learning models function by providing either model centric local or global explanations, which can be based on mechanistic interpretations revealing the inner working mechanisms of models or nonmechanistic approximations showing input feature output data relationships. In this paper, we draw on social philosophy to argue that interpreting machine learning outputs in certain normatively salient domains could require appealing to a third type of explanation that we call sociostructural explanation. The relevance of this explanation type is motivated by the fact that machine learning models are not isolated entities but are embedded within and shaped by social structures. Sociostructural explanations aim to illustrate how social structures contribute to and partially explain the outputs of machine learning models. We demonstrate the importance of sociostructural explanations by examining a racially biased healthcare allocation algorithm. Our proposal highlights the need for transparency beyond model interpretability, understanding the outputs of machine learning systems could require a broader analysis that extends beyond the understanding of the machine learning model itself.",

The system transformations given by quotient or clustering, representable functor, and Yoneda embedding are highlighted and discussed by machine learning examples. An adjunction between machine learning systems, a special machine learning system transformation loop, provides the optimal way of solving problems. Machine learning system transformations are linked and compared by their maps at 2-cell, natural transformations. New insights and structures can be obtained from universal properties and algebraic structures given by monads, which are generated from adjunctions.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning enables the extraction of useful information from large, diverse datasets. However, despite many successful applications, machine learning continues to suffer from performance and transparency issues. These challenges can be partially attributed to the limited use of domain knowledge by machine learning models. This research proposes using the domain knowledge represented in conceptual models to improve the preparation of the data used to train machine learning models. We develop and demonstrate a method, called the Conceptual Modeling for Machine Learning (CMML), which is comprised of guidelines for data preparation in machine learning and based on conceptual modeling constructs and principles. To assess the impact of CMML on machine learning outcomes, we first applied it to two real-world problems to evaluate its impact on model performance. We then solicited an assessment by data scientists on the applicability of the method. These results demonstrate the value of CMML for improving machine learning outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Security vulnerabilities play a vital role in network security system. Fuzzing technology is widely used as a vulnerability discovery technology to reduce damage in advance. However, traditional fuzzing techniques have many challenges, such as how to mutate input seed files, how to increase code coverage, and how to effectively bypass verification. Machine learning technology has been introduced as a new method into fuzzing test to alleviate these challenges. This paper reviews the research progress of using machine learning technology for fuzzing test in recent years, analyzes how machine learning improve the fuzz process and results, and sheds light on future work in fuzzing. Firstly, this paper discusses the reasons why machine learning techniques can be used for fuzzing scenarios and identifies six different stages in which machine learning have been used. Then this paper systematically study the machine learning based fuzzing models from selection of machine learning algorithm, pre-processing methods, datasets, evaluation metrics, and hyperparameters setting. Next, this paper assesses the performance of the machine learning models based on the frequently used evaluation metrics. The results of the evaluation prove that machine learning technology has an acceptable capability of categorize predictive for fuzzing. Finally, the comparison on capability of discovering vulnerabilities between traditional fuzzing tools and machine learning based fuzzing tools is analyzed. The results depict that the introduction of machine learning technology can improve the performance of fuzzing. However, there are still some limitations, such as unbalanced training samples and difficult to extract the characteristics related to vulnerabilities.",

In order to use machine learning in a safety-critical system, it is necessary to demonstrate the safety and security of the system through engineering processes. However, thus far, no such widely accepted engineering concepts or frameworks have been established for these systems. The key to using a machine learning model in a deductively engineered system is decomposing the data-driven training of machine learning models into requirement, design, and verification, particularly for machine learning models used in safety-critical systems. Simultaneously, open problems and relevant technical fields are not organized in a manner that enables researchers to select a theme and work on it. In this study, we identify, classify, and explore the open problems in engineering (safety-critical) machine learning systems --- that is, in terms of requirement, design, and verification of machine learning models and systems --- as well as discuss related works and research directions, using automated driving vehicles as an example. Our results show that machine learning models are characterized by a lack of requirements specification, lack of design specification, lack of interpretability, and lack of robustness. We also perform a gap analysis on a conventional system quality standard SQuARE with the characteristics of machine learning models to study quality models for machine learning systems. We find that a lack of requirements specification and lack of robustness have the greatest impact on conventional quality models.",

However, as the literature on graph learning booms with a vast number of emerging methods and techniques, it becomes increasingly difficult to manually design the optimal machine learning algorithm for different graph-related tasks. To tackle the challenge, automated graph machine learning, which aims at discovering the best hyper-parameter and neural architecture configuration for different graph tasks/data without manual design, is gaining an increasing number of attentions from the research community. In this paper, we extensively discuss automated graph machine learning approaches, covering hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) and neural architecture search (NAS) for graph machine learning. We briefly overview existing libraries designed for either graph machine learning or automated machine learning respectively, and further in depth introduce AutoGL, our dedicated and the world's first open-source library for automated graph machine learning. Also, we describe a tailored benchmark that supports unified, reproducible, and efficient evaluations. Last but not least, we share our insights on future research directions for automated graph machine learning. This paper is the first systematic and comprehensive discussion of approaches, libraries as well as directions for automated graph machine learning.",

Machine learning has become an increasingly important tool for analyzing and understanding the large-scale flood of data in astronomy. To take advantage of these tools, datasets are required for training and testing. However, building machine learning datasets for astronomy can be challenging. Astronomical data is collected from instruments built to explore science questions in a traditional fashion rather than to conduct machine learning. Thus, it is often the case that raw data, or even downstream processed data is not in a form amenable to machine learning. We explore the construction of machine learning datasets and we ask: what elements define effective machine learning datasets? We define effective machine learning datasets in astronomy to be formed with well-defined data points, structure, and metadata. We discuss why these elements are important for astronomical applications and ways to put them in practice. We posit that these qualities not only make the data suitable for machine learning, they also help to foster usable, reusable, and replicable science practices.",

To answer these questions, we conduct a bibliography analysis on 98 research papers in SE that use deep learning techniques. We find that 41 SE tasks in all SE phases have been facilitated by deep learning integrated solutions. In which, 84.7% papers only use standard deep learning models and their variants to solve SE problems. The practicability becomes a concern in utilizing deep learning techniques.

Biometric systems utilising deep learning have been shown to achieve auspicious recognition accuracy, surpassing human performance. Apart from said breakthrough advances in terms of biometric performance, the use of deep learning was reported to impact different covariates of biometrics such as algorithmic fairness, vulnerability to attacks, or template protection. Technologies of biometric template protection are designed to enable a secure and privacy-preserving deployment of biometrics. In the recent past, deep learning techniques have been frequently applied in biometric template protection systems for various purposes. This work provides an overview of how advances in deep learning take influence on the field of biometric template protection. The interrelation between improved biometric performance rates and security in biometric template protection is elaborated. Further, the use of deep learning for obtaining feature representations that are suitable for biometric template protection is discussed. Novel methods that apply deep learning to achieve various goals of biometric template protection are surveyed along with deep learning-based attacks.",

To achieve this, a comprehensive overview of deep learning and its usage in computer vision is given, that includes a description of the most frequently used neural models and their main application areas. Then, the standard methodology and tools used for designing deep-learning based vision systems are presented. Afterwards, a review of the principal work using deep learning in robot vision is presented, as well as current and future trends related to the use of deep learning in robotics.

While neural networks have a long history, recent advances have greatly improved their performance in computer vision, natural language processing, etc. From the statistical and scientific perspective, it is natural to ask: What is deep learning? What are the new characteristics of deep learning, compared with classical methods? What are the theoretical foundations of deep learning? To answer these questions, we introduce common neural network models (e.g., convolutional neural nets, recurrent neural nets, generative adversarial nets) and training techniques (e.g., stochastic gradient descent, dropout, batch normalization) from a statistical point of view. Along the way, we highlight new characteristics of deep learning (including depth and over-parametrization) and explain their practical and theoretical benefits. We also sample recent results on theories of deep learning, many of which are only suggestive. While a complete understanding of deep learning remains elusive, we hope that our perspectives and discussions serve as a stimulus for new statistical research.",

Yet, what deep learning is really doing is still an open question. There are a lot of works in this direction. For example, [5] tried to explain deep learning by group renormalization, and [6] tried to explain deep learning from the view of functional approximation. In order to address this very crucial question, here we see deep learning from perspective of mechanical learning and learning machine (see [1], [2]). From this particular angle, we can see deep learning much better and answer with confidence: What deep learning is really doing? why it works well, how it works, and how much data is necessary for learning. We also will discuss advantages and disadvantages of deep learning at the end of this work.",

        "abstract": "Numerous previous works have studied deep learning algorithms applied in the context of side-channel attacks, which demonstrated the ability to perform successful key recoveries. These studies show that modern cryptographic devices are increasingly threatened by side-channel attacks with the help of deep learning. However, the existing countermeasures are designed to resist classical side-channel attacks, and cannot protect cryptographic devices from deep learning based side-channel attacks. Thus, there arises a strong need for countermeasures against deep learning based side-channel attacks. Although deep learning has the high potential in solving complex problems, it is vulnerable to adversarial attacks in the form of subtle perturbations to inputs that lead a model to predict incorrectly.   In this paper, we propose a kind of novel countermeasures based on adversarial attacks that is specifically designed against deep learning based side-channel attacks. We estimate several models commonly used in deep learning based side-channel attacks to evaluate the proposed countermeasures. It shows that our approach can effectively protect cryptographic devices from deep learning based side-channel attacks in practice. In addition, our experiments show that the new countermeasures can also resist classical side-channel attacks.",

Particularly, in recent years, with the application of new sensors and deep learning technologies extending to the autonomous field, the development of autonomous driving technology has continued to make breakthroughs. Thus, many carmakers and high-tech giants dedicated to research and system development of autonomous driving. However, as the foundation of autonomous driving, the deep learning technology faces many new security risks. The academic community has proposed deep learning countermeasures against the adversarial examples and AI backdoor, and has introduced them into the autonomous driving field for verification. Deep learning security matters to autonomous driving system security, and then matters to personal safety, which is an issue that deserves attention and research.This paper provides an summary of the concepts, developments and recent research in deep learning security technologies in autonomous driving. Firstly, we briefly introduce the deep learning framework and pipeline in the autonomous driving system, which mainly include the deep learning technologies and algorithms commonly used in this field. Moreover, we focus on the potential security threats of the deep learning based autonomous driving system in each functional layer in turn. We reviews the development of deep learning attack technologies to autonomous driving, investigates the State-of-the-Art algorithms, and reveals the potential risks. At last, we provides an outlook on deep learning security in the autonomous driving field and proposes recommendations for building a safe and trustworthy autonomous driving system.",

        "abstract": "Refactoring is one of the most important activities in software engineering which is used to improve the quality of a software system. With the advancement of deep learning techniques, researchers are attempting to apply deep learning techniques to software refactoring. Consequently, dozens of deep learning-based refactoring approaches have been proposed. However, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews on such works as well as a taxonomy for deep learning-based refactoring. To this end, in this paper, we present a survey on deep learning-based software refactoring. We classify related works into five categories according to the major tasks they cover. Among these categories, we further present key aspects (i.e., code smell types, refactoring types, training strategies, and evaluation) to give insight into the details of the technologies that have supported refactoring through deep learning. The classification indicates that there is an imbalance in the adoption of deep learning techniques for the process of refactoring. Most of the deep learning techniques have been used for the detection of code smells and the recommendation of refactoring solutions as found in 56.25\\% and 33.33\\% of the literature respectively. In contrast, only 6.25\\% and 4.17\\% were towards the end-to-end code transformation as refactoring and the mining of refactorings, respectively. Notably, we found no literature representation for the quality assurance for refactoring. We also observe that most of the deep learning techniques have been used to support refactoring processes occurring at the method level whereas classes and variables attracted minimal attention. Finally, we discuss the challenges and limitations associated with the employment of deep learning-based refactorings and present some potential research opportunities for future work.",

As deep learning more popular in various applications, researchers often come to question whether to generate features or use raw sequences for deep learning. To answer this question, we study the prediction accuracy of precursor miRNA prediction of feature-based deep belief network and sequence-based convolution neural network. Tested on a variant of six-layer convolution neural net and three-layer deep belief network, we find the raw sequence input based convolution neural network model performs similar or slightly better than feature based deep belief networks with best accuracy values of 0.995 and 0.990, respectively. Both the models outperform existing benchmarks models. The results shows us that if provided large enough data, well devised raw sequence based deep learning models can replace feature based deep learning models. However, construction of well behaved deep learning model can be very challenging. In cased features can be easily extracted, feature-based deep learning models may be a better alternative.",

The methodology so far has produced outstanding results due to a productive synergy of function approximation, under plausible assumptions of irreducibility and the efficiency of back-propagation family of algorithms. We examine these winning traits of deep learning, and also observe the various known failure modes of deep learning.

We present this survey to connect different isolated areas in deep learning with their relation to transferability, and to provide a unified and complete view to investigating transferability through the whole lifecycle of deep learning. The survey elaborates the fundamental goals and challenges in parallel with the core principles and methods, covering recent cornerstones in deep architectures, pre-training, task adaptation and domain adaptation. This highlights unanswered questions on the appropriate objectives for learning transferable knowledge and for adapting the knowledge to new tasks and domains, avoiding catastrophic forgetting and negative transfer.

This paper considers the risks caused by these vulnerabilities by studying their impact on common deep learning applications such as voice recognition and image classifications.

In order to apply deep learning to these tasks, source code needs to be represented in a format that is suitable for input into the deep learning model. Most approaches to representing source code, such as tokens, abstract syntax trees (ASTs), data flow graphs (DFGs), and control flow graphs (CFGs) only focus on the code itself and do not take into account additional context that could be useful for deep learning models. In this paper, we argue that it is beneficial for deep learning models to have access to additional contextual information about the code being analysed. We present preliminary evidence that encoding context from the call hierarchy along with information from the code itself can improve the performance of a state-of-the-art deep learning model for two software engineering tasks. We outline our research agenda for adding further contextual information to source code representations for deep learning.",

        "abstract": "The convergence of 5G architecture and deep learning has gained a lot of research interests in both the fields of wireless communication and artificial intelligence. This is because deep learning technologies have been identified to be the potential driver of the 5G technologies, that make up the 5G architecture. Hence, there have been extensive surveys on the convergence of 5G architecture and deep learning. However, most of the existing survey papers mainly focused on how deep learning can converge with a specific 5G technology, thus, not covering the full spectrum of the 5G architecture. Although there is a recent survey paper that appears to be robust, a review of that paper shows that it is not well structured to specifically cover the convergence of deep learning and the 5G technologies. Hence, this paper provides a robust overview of the convergence of the key 5G technologies and deep learning. The challenges faced by such convergence are discussed. In addition, a brief overview of the future 6G architecture, and how it can converge with deep learning is also discussed.",

        "abstract": "Topological data analysis (TDA) provides insight into data shape. The summaries obtained by these methods are principled global descriptions of multi-dimensional data whilst exhibiting stable properties such as robustness to deformation and noise. Such properties are desirable in deep learning pipelines but they are typically obtained using non-TDA strategies. This is partly caused by the difficulty of combining TDA constructs (e.g. barcode and persistence diagrams) with current deep learning algorithms. Fortunately, we are now witnessing a growth of deep learning applications embracing topologically-guided components. In this survey, we review the nascent field of topological deep learning by first revisiting the core concepts of TDA. We then explore how the use of TDA techniques has evolved over time to support deep learning frameworks, and how they can be integrated into different aspects of deep learning. Furthermore, we touch on TDA usage for analyzing existing deep models; deep topological analytics. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future prospects of topological deep learning.",

This survey focuses on code search, that is, to retrieve code that matches a given query by effectively capturing the semantic similarity between the query and code. Deep learning, being able to extract complex semantics information, has achieved great success in this field. Recently, various deep learning methods, such as graph neural networks and pretraining models, have been applied to code search with significant progress. Deep learning is now the leading paradigm for code search. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of deep learning-based code search. We review the existing deep learning-based code search framework which maps query/code to vectors and measures their similarity. Furthermore, we propose a new taxonomy to illustrate the state-of-the-art deep learning-based code search in a three-steps process: query semantics modeling, code semantics modeling, and matching modeling which involves the deep learning model training. Finally, we suggest potential avenues for future research in this promising field.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we design novel interactive deep learning methods to improve semantic interactions in visual analytics applications. The ability of semantic interaction to infer analysts' precise intents during sensemaking is dependent on the quality of the underlying data representation. We propose the $\\text{DeepSI}_{\\text{finetune}}$ framework that integrates deep learning into the human-in-the-loop interactive sensemaking pipeline, with two important properties. First, deep learning extracts meaningful representations from raw data, which improves semantic interaction inference. Second, semantic interactions are exploited to fine-tune the deep learning representations, which then further improves semantic interaction inference. This feedback loop between human interaction and deep learning enables efficient learning of user- and task-specific representations. To evaluate the advantage of embedding the deep learning within the semantic interaction loop, we compare $\\text{DeepSI}_{\\text{finetune}}$ against a state-of-the-art but more basic use of deep learning as only a feature extractor pre-processed outside of the interactive loop. Results of two complementary studies, a human-centered qualitative case study and an algorithm-centered simulation-based quantitative experiment, show that $\\text{DeepSI}_{\\text{finetune}}$ more accurately captures users' complex mental models with fewer interactions.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers security risks buried in the data processing pipeline in common deep learning applications. Deep learning models usually assume a fixed scale for their training and input data. To allow deep learning applications to handle a wide range of input data, popular frameworks, such as Caffe, TensorFlow, and Torch, all provide data scaling functions to resize input to the dimensions used by deep learning models. Image scaling algorithms are intended to preserve the visual features of an image after scaling. However, common image scaling algorithms are not designed to handle human crafted images. Attackers can make the scaling outputs look dramatically different from the corresponding input images.   This paper presents a downscaling attack that targets the data scaling process in deep learning applications. By carefully crafting input data that mismatches with the dimension used by deep learning models, attackers can create deceiving effects. A deep learning application effectively consumes data that are not the same as those presented to users. The visual inconsistency enables practical evasion and data poisoning attacks to deep learning applications. This paper presents proof-of-concept attack samples to popular deep-learning-based image classification applications. To address the downscaling attacks, the paper also suggests multiple potential mitigation strategies.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning has achieved great success as a powerful classification tool and also made great progress in sematic segmentation. As a result, many researchers also believe that deep learning is the most powerful tool for pixel level image segmentation. Could deep learning achieve the same pixel level accuracy as traditional image segmentation techniques by mapping the features of the object into a non-linear function? This paper gives a short survey of the accuracies achieved by deep learning so far in image classification and image segmentation. Compared to the high accuracies achieved by deep learning in classifying limited categories in international vision challenges, the image segmentation accuracies achieved by deep learning in the same challenges are only about eighty percent. On the contrary, the image segmentation accuracies achieved in international biomedical challenges are close to ninty five percent. Why the difference is so big? Since the accuracies of the competitors methods are only evaluated based on their submitted results instead of reproducing the results by submitting the source codes or the software, are the achieved accuracies verifiable or overhyped? We are going to find it out by analyzing the working principle of deep learning. Finally, we compared the accuracies of state of the art deep learning methods with a threshold selection method quantitatively. Experimental results showed that the threshold selection method could achieve significantly higher accuracy than deep learning methods in image segmentation.",

        "abstract": "With the success of deep learning techniques in a broad range of application domains, many deep learning software frameworks have been developed and are being updated frequently to adapt to new hardware features and software libraries, which bring a big challenge for end users and system administrators. To address this problem, container techniques are widely used to simplify the deployment and management of deep learning software. However, it remains unknown whether container techniques bring any performance penalty to deep learning applications. The purpose of this work is to systematically evaluate the impact of docker container on the performance of deep learning applications. We first benchmark the performance of system components (IO, CPU and GPU) in a docker container and the host system and compare the results to see if there's any difference. According to our results, we find that computational intensive jobs, either running on CPU or GPU, have small overhead indicating docker containers can be applied to deep learning programs. Then we evaluate the performance of some popular deep learning tools deployed in a docker container and the host system. It turns out that the docker container will not cause noticeable drawbacks while running those deep learning tools. So encapsulating deep learning tool in a container is a feasible solution.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning has gained substantial popularity in recent years. Developers mainly rely on libraries and tools to add deep learning capabilities to their software. What kinds of bugs are frequently found in such software? What are the root causes of such bugs? What impacts do such bugs have? Which stages of deep learning pipeline are more bug prone? Are there any antipatterns? Understanding such characteristics of bugs in deep learning software has the potential to foster the development of better deep learning platforms, debugging mechanisms, development practices, and encourage the development of analysis and verification frameworks. Therefore, we study 2716 high-quality posts from Stack Overflow and 500 bug fix commits from Github about five popular deep learning libraries Caffe, Keras, Tensorflow, Theano, and Torch to understand the types of bugs, root causes of bugs, impacts of bugs, bug-prone stage of deep learning pipeline as well as whether there are some common antipatterns found in this buggy software. The key findings of our study include: data bug and logic bug are the most severe bug types in deep learning software appearing more than 48% of the times, major root causes of these bugs are Incorrect Model Parameter (IPS) and Structural Inefficiency (SI) showing up more than 43% of the times. We have also found that the bugs in the usage of deep learning libraries have some common antipatterns that lead to a strong correlation of bug types among the libraries.",

I investigate various deep learning methods for asset pricing, especially for risk premia measurement. All models take the same set of predictive signals (firm characteristics, systematic risks and macroeconomics). I demonstrate high performance of all kinds of state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning methods, and figure out that RNNs with memory mechanism and attention have the best performance in terms of predictivity. Furthermore, I demonstrate large economic gains to investors using deep learning forecasts. The results of my comparative experiments highlight the importance of domain knowledge and financial theory when designing deep learning models. I also show return prediction tasks bring new challenges to deep learning. The time varying distribution causes distribution shift problem, which is essential for financial time series prediction. I demonstrate that deep learning methods can improve asset risk premium measurement. Due to the booming deep learning studies, they can constantly promote the study of underlying financial mechanisms behind asset pricing. I also propose a promising research method that learning from data and figuring out the underlying economic mechanisms through explainable artificial intelligence (AI) methods.

Empowered by this learning capability, it has become a powerful tool for solving complex problems and is the core driver of many groundbreaking technologies and innovations. Building a deep learning model is challenging due to the algorithm's complexity and the dynamic nature of real-world problems. Several studies have reviewed deep learning concepts and applications. However, the studies mostly focused on the types of deep learning models and convolutional neural network architectures, offering limited coverage of the state-of-the-art deep learning models and their applications in solving complex problems across different domains. Therefore, motivated by the limitations, this study aims to comprehensively review the state-of-the-art deep learning models in computer vision, natural language processing, time series analysis and pervasive computing, and robotics. We highlight the key features of the models and their effectiveness in solving the problems within each domain. Furthermore, this study presents the fundamentals of deep learning, various deep learning model types and prominent convolutional neural network architectures.

        "abstract": "Deep Learning applications are becoming increasingly popular. Developers of deep learning systems strive to write more efficient code. Deep learning systems are constantly evolving, imposing tighter development timelines and increasing complexity, which may lead to bad design decisions. A copy-paste approach is widely used among deep learning developers because they rely on common frameworks and duplicate similar tasks. Developers often fail to properly propagate changes to all clones fragments during a maintenance activity. To our knowledge, no study has examined code cloning practices in deep learning development. Given the negative impacts of clones on software quality reported in the studies on traditional systems, it is very important to understand the characteristics and potential impacts of code clones on deep learning systems. To this end, we use the NiCad tool to detect clones from 59 Python, 14 C# and 6 Java-based deep learning systems and an equal number of traditional software systems. We then analyze the frequency and distribution of code clones in deep learning and traditional systems. We do further analysis of the distribution of code clones using location-based taxonomy. We also study the correlation between bugs and code clones to assess the impacts of clones on the quality of the studied systems. Finally, we introduce a code clone taxonomy related to deep learning programs and identify the deep learning system development phases in which cloning has the highest risk of faults. Our results show that code cloning is a frequent practice in deep learning systems and that deep learning developers often clone code from files in distant repositories in the system. In addition, we found that code cloning occurs more frequently during DL model construction. And that hyperparameters setting is the phase during which cloning is the riskiest, since it often leads to faults.",

Computer vision, combined with deep learning, has the potential to bring about a relatively inexpensive, robust solution to autonomous driving. To prepare deep learning for industry uptake and practical applications, neural networks will require large data sets that represent all possible driving environments and scenarios. We collect a large data set of highway data and apply deep learning and computer vision algorithms to problems such as car and lane detection. We show how existing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be used to perform lane and vehicle detection while running at frame rates required for a real-time system.

Deep learning demonstrates its weakness especially when the number of training samples is small. The advantages and disadvantages of linear-regression-based methods and deep learning are analyzed and compared.

This flexible design effectively captures channel impairments and optimizes transmitter and receiver operations jointly in single-antenna, multiple-antenna, and multiuser communications. Next, we present the benefits of deep learning in spectrum situation awareness ranging from channel modeling and estimation to signal detection and classification tasks. Deep learning improves the performance when the model-based methods fail. Finally, we discuss how deep learning applies to wireless communication security. In this context, adversarial machine learning provides novel means to launch and defend against wireless attacks.

The developed deployment approach allows deep learning models to be turned into real-time smartphone apps with ease based on publicly available deep learning and smartphone software tools. This approach is applied to six popular or representative convolutional neural network models and the validation results based on the benchmarking metrics are reported.",

        "abstract": "Lack of enough labeled data is a major problem in building machine learning based models when the manual annotation (labeling) is error-prone, expensive, tedious, and time-consuming. In this paper, we introduce an iterative deep learning based method to improve segmentation and counting of cells based on unbiased stereology applied to regions of interest of extended depth of field (EDF) images. This method uses an existing machine learning algorithm called the adaptive segmentation algorithm (ASA) to generate masks (verified by a user) for EDF images to train deep learning models. Then an iterative deep learning approach is used to feed newly predicted and accepted deep learning masks/images (verified by a user) to the training set of the deep learning model. The error rate in unbiased stereology count of cells on an unseen test set reduced from about 3 % to less than 1 % after 5 iterations of the iterative deep learning based unbiased stereology process.",

        "abstract": "The rise of deep learning algorithms has led many researchers to withdraw from using classic signal processing methods for sound generation. Deep learning models have achieved expressive voice synthesis, realistic sound textures, and musical notes from virtual instruments. However, the most suitable deep learning architecture is still under investigation. The choice of architecture is tightly coupled to the audio representations. A sound's original waveform can be too dense and rich for deep learning models to deal with efficiently - and complexity increases training time and computational cost. Also, it does not represent sound in the manner in which it is perceived. Therefore, in many cases, the raw audio has been transformed into a compressed and more meaningful form using upsampling, feature-extraction, or even by adopting a higher level illustration of the waveform. Furthermore, conditional on the form chosen, additional conditioning representations, different model architectures, and numerous metrics for evaluating the reconstructed sound have been investigated. This paper provides an overview of audio representations applied to sound synthesis using deep learning. Additionally, it presents the most significant methods for developing and evaluating a sound synthesis architecture using deep learning models, always depending on the audio representation.",

To understand this phenomenon theoretically, we develop a new approximation and estimation error analysis of deep learning with the ReLU activation for functions in a Besov space and its variant with mixed smoothness. The Besov space is a considerably general function space including the Holder space and Sobolev space, and especially can capture spatial inhomogeneity of smoothness. Through the analysis in the Besov space, it is shown that deep learning can achieve the minimax optimal rate and outperform any non-adaptive (linear) estimator such as kernel ridge regression, which shows that deep learning has higher adaptivity to the spatial inhomogeneity of the target function than other estimators such as linear ones. In addition to this, it is shown that deep learning can avoid the curse of dimensionality if the target function is in a mixed smooth Besov space. We also show that the dependency of the convergence rate on the dimensionality is tight due to its minimax optimality. These results support high adaptivity of deep learning and its superior ability as a feature extractor.",

However, paradoxes in the training and effectiveness of deep learning networks are being investigated and insights are being found in the geometry of high-dimensional spaces. A mathematical theory of deep learning would illuminate how they function, allow us to assess the strengths and weaknesses of different network architectures and lead to major improvements. Deep learning has provided natural ways for humans to communicate with digital devices and is foundational for building artificial general intelligence.

Despite their increased predictive power, model transparency and human explainability remain a significant challenge due to the \"black box\" nature of modern deep learning models. In many cases the desired balance between interpretability and performance is predominately task specific. Human-centric domains such as healthcare necessitate a renewed focus on understanding how and why these frameworks are arriving at critical and potentially life-or-death decisions. Given the quantity of research and empirical successes of deep learning for computer vision, most of the existing interpretability research has focused on image processing techniques. Comparatively, less attention has been paid to interpreting deep learning frameworks using sequential data. Given recent deep learning advancements in highly sequential domains such as natural language processing and physiological signal processing, the need for deep sequential explanations is at an all-time high. In this paper, we review current techniques for interpreting deep learning techniques involving sequential data, identify similarities to non-sequential methods, and discuss current limitations and future avenues of sequential interpretability research.",

While there have been some work on safety in deep learning, most papers typically focus on high-level safety concerns. In this work, we seek to dive into the safety concerns of deep learning methods and present a concise enumeration on a deeply technical level.

With the rapid increase in the computing power of mobile devices, developers can embed deep learning models into their apps for building more competitive products with more accurate and faster responses. Although there are several works about adversarial attacks against deep learning models in mobile apps, they all need information about the models' internals (i.e., structures, weights) or need to modify the models. In this paper, we propose an effective black-box approach by training a substitute model to spoof the deep learning system inside the apps. To evaluate our approach, we select 10 real-world deep-learning apps with high popularity from Google Play to perform black-box adversarial attacks. Through the study, we find three factors that can influence the performance of attacks. Our approach can reach a relatively high attack success rate of 66.60% on average. Compared with other adversarial attacks on mobile deep learning models, in terms of the average attack success rates, our approach outperforms counterparts by 27.63%.",

Game theory has been used to answer some of the basic questions about adversarial deep learning such as the existence of a classifier with optimal robustness and the existence of optimal adversarial samples for a given class of classifiers. In most previous work, adversarial deep learning was formulated as a simultaneous game and the strategy spaces are assumed to be certain probability distributions in order for the Nash equilibrium to exist. But, this assumption is not applicable to the practical situation. In this paper, we give answers to these basic questions for the practical case where the classifiers are DNNs with a given structure, by formulating the adversarial deep learning as sequential games. The existence of Stackelberg equilibria for these games are proved. Furthermore, it is shown that the equilibrium DNN has the largest adversarial accuracy among all DNNs with the same structure, when Carlini-Wagner's margin loss is used. Trade-off between robustness and accuracy in adversarial deep learning is also studied from game theoretical aspect.",

Interpretation models enable the understanding of the inner workings of deep learning models and offer a sense of security in detecting the misuse of artifacts in the input data. Similar to prediction models, interpretation models are also susceptible to adversarial inputs. This work introduces two attacks, AdvEdge and AdvEdge$^{+}$, that deceive both the target deep learning model and the coupled interpretation model. We assess the effectiveness of proposed attacks against two deep learning model architectures coupled with four interpretation models that represent different categories of interpretation models. Our experiments include the attack implementation using various attack frameworks. We also explore the potential countermeasures against such attacks. Our analysis shows the effectiveness of our attacks in terms of deceiving the deep learning models and their interpreters, and highlights insights to improve and circumvent the attacks.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning compilers help address the difficulties of deploying deep learning models on diverse types of hardware. Testing deep learning compilers is highly crucial, because they are impacting countless AI applications that use them for model optimization and deployment. To test deep learning compilers, random testing, the testing method popularly used for compiler testing practices, faces the challenge of generating semantically valid test inputs, i.e., deep learning models that satisfy the semantic model specifications (in short as semantic specifications). To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel approach named Isra, including a domain-specific constraint solver that resolves the constraints from the semantic specifications without backtracking. We implement and apply our approach to three popular real-world deep learning compilers including TVM, Glow, and a commercial compiler named SophGo. The evaluation results show that Isra is more effective than the state-of-the-art approaches and the baseline approaches on constructing valid test inputs for compiler-bug detection, and Isra successfully finds 24 previously unknown bugs in released versions of the three compilers. These results indicate Isra's effectiveness and practical value.",

Large quantities of deep learning methods have been proposed to handle various problems appeared in face recognition. Quite a lot deep methods claimed that they have gained or even surpassed human-level face verification performance in certain databases. As we know, face image quality poses a great challenge to traditional face recognition methods, e.g. model-driven methods with hand-crafted features. However, a little research focus on the impact of face image quality on deep learning methods, and even human performance. Therefore, we raise a question: Is face image quality still one of the challenges for deep learning based face recognition, especially in unconstrained condition. Based on this, we further investigate this problem on human level. In this paper, we partition face images into three different quality sets to evaluate the performance of deep learning methods on cross-quality face images in the wild, and then design a human face verification experiment on these cross-quality data. The result indicates that quality issue still needs to be studied thoroughly in deep learning, human own better capability in building the relations between different face images with large quality gaps, and saying deep learning method surpasses human-level is too optimistic.",

Text classification is a class of tasks that automatically classifies a set of documents into multiple predefined categories based on their content and subject matter. Thus, the main goal of text classification is to enable users to extract information from textual resources and process processes such as retrieval, classification, and machine learning techniques together in order to classify different categories. Many new techniques of deep learning have already achieved excellent results in natural language processing. The success of these learning algorithms relies on their ability to understand complex models and non-linear relationships in data. However, finding the right structure, architecture, and techniques for text classification is a challenge for researchers. This paper introduces deep learning-based text classification algorithms, including important steps required for text classification tasks such as feature extraction, feature reduction, and evaluation strategies and methods. At the end of the article, different deep learning text classification methods are compared and summarized.",

Deep learning models, however, have also been shown to perform best on large corpora of data. When processing EEG, a natural approach is to combine EEG datasets from different experiments to train large deep-learning models. However, most EEG experiments use custom channel montages, requiring the data to be transformed into a common space. Previous methods have used the raw EEG signal to extract features of interest and focused on using a common feature space across EEG datasets. While this is a sensible approach, it underexploits the potential richness of EEG raw data. Here, we explore using spatial attention applied to EEG electrode coordinates to perform channel harmonization of raw EEG data, allowing us to train deep learning on EEG data using different montages. We test this model on a gender classification task. We first show that spatial attention increases model performance. Then, we show that a deep learning model trained on data using different channel montages performs significantly better than deep learning models trained on fixed 23- and 128-channel data montages.",

Large deep learning models are developed for learning rich representations of complex data. There are two challenges to overcome before deep learning can be widely adopted in multimedia and other applications. One is usability, namely the implementation of different models and training algorithms must be done by non-experts without much effort especially when the model is large and complex. The other is scalability, that is the deep learning system must be able to provision for a huge demand of computing resources for training large models with massive datasets. To address these two challenges, in this paper, we design a distributed deep learning platform called SINGA which has an intuitive programming model based on the common layer abstraction of deep learning models. Good scalability is achieved through flexible distributed training architecture and specific optimization techniques. SINGA runs on GPUs as well as on CPUs, and we show that it outperforms many other state-of-the-art deep learning systems.

Though the relationship between sleep and physical activity is known to be important, it is not yet fully understood. The explosion in popularity of actigraphy and wearable devices, provides a unique opportunity to understand this relationship. Leveraging this information source requires new tools to be developed to facilitate data-driven research for sleep and activity patient-recommendations.   In this paper we explore the use of deep learning to build sleep quality prediction models based on actigraphy data. We first use deep learning as a pure model building device by performing human activity recognition (HAR) on raw sensor data, and using deep learning to build sleep prediction models. We compare the deep learning models with those build using classical approaches, i.e. logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest and adaboost. Secondly, we employ the advantage of deep learning with its ability to handle high dimensional datasets. We explore several deep learning models on the raw wearable sensor output without performing HAR or any other feature extraction.   Our results show that using a convolutional neural network on the raw wearables output improves the predictive value of sleep quality from physical activity, by an additional 8% compared to state-of-the-art non-deep learning approaches, which itself shows a 15% improvement over current practice. Moreover, utilizing deep learning on raw data eliminates the need for data pre-processing and simplifies the overall workflow to analyze actigraphy data for sleep and physical activity research.",

Advantages of deep learning include the ability to capture highly complicated features, weak involvement of human engineering, etc. However, it is still virtually impossible to use deep learning to analyze programs since deep architectures cannot be trained effectively with pure back propagation. In this pioneering paper, we propose the \"coding criterion\" to build program vector representations, which are the premise of deep learning for program analysis. Our representation learning approach directly makes deep learning a reality in this new field. We evaluate the learned vector representations both qualitatively and quantitatively. We conclude, based on the experiments, the coding criterion is successful in building program representations. To evaluate whether deep learning is beneficial for program analysis, we feed the representations to deep neural networks, and achieve higher accuracy in the program classification task than \"shallow\" methods, such as logistic regression and the support vector machine. This result confirms the feasibility of deep learning to analyze programs. It also gives primary evidence of its success in this new field.

        "abstract": "Point cloud is point sets defined in 3D metric space. Point cloud has become one of the most significant data format for 3D representation. Its gaining increased popularity as a result of increased availability of acquisition devices, such as LiDAR, as well as increased application in areas such as robotics, autonomous driving, augmented and virtual reality. Deep learning is now the most powerful tool for data processing in computer vision, becoming the most preferred technique for tasks such as classification, segmentation, and detection. While deep learning techniques are mainly applied to data with a structured grid, point cloud, on the other hand, is unstructured. The unstructuredness of point clouds makes use of deep learning for its processing directly very challenging. Earlier approaches overcome this challenge by preprocessing the point cloud into a structured grid format at the cost of increased computational cost or lost of depth information. Recently, however, many state-of-the-arts deep learning techniques that directly operate on point cloud are being developed. This paper contains a survey of the recent state-of-the-art deep learning techniques that mainly focused on point cloud data. We first briefly discussed the major challenges faced when using deep learning directly on point cloud, we also briefly discussed earlier approaches which overcome the challenges by preprocessing the point cloud into a structured grid. We then give the review of the various state-of-the-art deep learning approaches that directly process point cloud in its unstructured form. We introduced the popular 3D point cloud benchmark datasets. And we also further discussed the application of deep learning in popular 3D vision tasks including classification, segmentation and detection.",

        "abstract": "Over the past few years, deep learning has risen to the foreground as a topic of massive interest, mainly as a result of successes obtained in solving large-scale image processing tasks. There are multiple challenging mathematical problems involved in applying deep learning: most deep learning methods require the solution of hard optimisation problems, and a good understanding of the tradeoff between computational effort, amount of data and model complexity is required to successfully design a deep learning approach for a given problem. A large amount of progress made in deep learning has been based on heuristic explorations, but there is a growing effort to mathematically understand the structure in existing deep learning methods and to systematically design new deep learning methods to preserve certain types of structure in deep learning. In this article, we review a number of these directions: some deep neural networks can be understood as discretisations of dynamical systems, neural networks can be designed to have desirable properties such as invertibility or group equivariance, and new algorithmic frameworks based on conformal Hamiltonian systems and Riemannian manifolds to solve the optimisation problems have been proposed. We conclude our review of each of these topics by discussing some open problems that we consider to be interesting directions for future research.",

        "abstract": "Providing online adaptive lightweight time series anomaly detection without human intervention and domain knowledge is highly valuable. Several such anomaly detection approaches have been introduced in the past years, but all of them were only implemented in one deep learning library. With the development of deep learning libraries, it is unclear how different deep learning libraries impact these anomaly detection approaches since there is no such evaluation available. Randomly choosing a deep learning library to implement an anomaly detection approach might not be able to show the true performance of the approach. It might also mislead users in believing one approach is better than another. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the impact of deep learning libraries on online adaptive lightweight time series anomaly detection by implementing two state-of-the-art anomaly detection approaches in three well-known deep learning libraries and evaluating how these two approaches are individually affected by the three deep learning libraries. A series of experiments based on four real-world open-source time series datasets were conducted. The results provide a good reference to select an appropriate deep learning library for online adaptive lightweight anomaly detection.",

        "abstract": "Large-scale, high-quality data are considered an essential factor for the successful application of many deep learning techniques. Meanwhile, numerous real-world deep learning tasks still have to contend with the lack of sufficient amounts of high-quality data. Additionally, issues such as model robustness, fairness, and trustworthiness are also closely related to training data. Consequently, a huge number of studies in the existing literature have focused on the data aspect in deep learning tasks. Some typical data optimization techniques include data augmentation, logit perturbation, sample weighting, and data condensation. These techniques usually come from different deep learning divisions and their theoretical inspirations or heuristic motivations may seem unrelated to each other. This study aims to organize a wide range of existing data optimization methodologies for deep learning from the previous literature, and makes the effort to construct a comprehensive taxonomy for them. The constructed taxonomy considers the diversity of split dimensions, and deep sub-taxonomies are constructed for each dimension. On the basis of the taxonomy, connections among the extensive data optimization methods for deep learning are built in terms of four aspects. We probe into rendering several promising and interesting future directions. The constructed taxonomy and the revealed connections will enlighten the better understanding of existing methods and the design of novel data optimization techniques. Furthermore, our aspiration for this survey is to promote data optimization as an independent subdivision of deep learning.

Since deep learning is known to be computing- and memory-intensive, traditional fault-tolerant approaches based on redundant computing will incur substantial overhead including power consumption and chip area. To this end, we propose to characterize deep learning vulnerability difference across both neurons and bits of each neuron, and leverage the vulnerability difference to enable selective protection of the deep learning processing components from the perspective of architecture layer and circuit layer respectively. At the same time, we observe the correlation between model quantization and bit protection overhead of the underlying processing elements of deep learning accelerators, and propose to reduce the bit protection overhead by adding additional quantization constrain without compromising the model accuracy. Finally, we employ Bayesian optimization strategy to co-optimize the correlated cross-layer design parameters at algorithm layer, architecture layer, and circuit layer to minimize the hardware resource consumption while fulfilling multiple user constraints including reliability, accuracy, and performance of the deep learning processing at the same time.",

These deep learning algorithms have demonstrated great results in different fields. Deep learning has particularly witnessed for a great achievement of human level performance across a number of domains in computer vision and pattern recognition. For the achievement of state-of-the-art performances in diverse domains, the deep learning used different architectures and these architectures used activation functions to perform various computations between hidden and output layers of any architecture. This paper presents a survey on the existing studies of deep learning in handwriting recognition field. Even though the recent progress indicates that the deep learning methods has provided valuable means for speeding up or proving accurate results in handwriting recognition, but following from the extensive literature survey, the present study finds that the deep learning has yet to revolutionize more and has to resolve many of the most pressing challenges in this field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Additionally, an inadequate availability of labelled data to train presents problems in this domain. Nevertheless, the present handwriting recognition survey foresees deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several domains as image processing, speech recognition, computer vision, machine translation, robotics and control, medical imaging, medical information processing, bio-informatics, natural language processing, cyber security, and many others.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of deep learning, the implementation of intricate algorithms and substantial data processing have become standard elements of deep learning projects. As a result, the code has become progressively complex as the software evolves, which is difficult to maintain and understand. Existing studies have investigated the impact of refactoring on software quality within traditional software. However, the insight of code refactoring in the context of deep learning is still unclear. This study endeavors to fill this knowledge gap by empirically examining the current state of code refactoring in deep learning realm, and practitioners' views on refactoring. We first manually analyzed the commit history of five popular and well-maintained deep learning projects (e.g., PyTorch). We mined 4,921 refactoring practices in historical commits and measured how different types and elements of refactoring operations are distributed and found that refactoring operation types' distribution in deep learning projects is different from it in traditional Java software. We then surveyed 159 practitioners about their views of code refactoring in deep learning projects and their expectations of current refactoring tools. The result of the survey showed that refactoring research and the development of related tools in the field of deep learning are crucial for improving project maintainability and code quality, and that current refactoring tools do not adequately meet the needs of practitioners. Lastly, we provided our perspective on the future advancement of refactoring tools and offered suggestions for developers' development practices.",

In this way, we elevate the capabilities of deep learning models by incorporating quantile regression, thus providing a more nuanced understanding of predictive values. We provide an implementation of prominent deep learning models for multi-step ahead time series prediction and evaluate their performance under high volatility and extreme conditions. We include multivariate and univariate modelling, strategies and provide a comparison with conventional deep learning models from the literature. Our models are tested on two cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin and Ethereum, using daily close-price data and selected benchmark time series datasets. The results show that integrating a quantile loss function with deep learning provides additional predictions for selected quantiles without a loss in the prediction accuracy when compared to the literature. Our quantile model has the ability to handle volatility more effectively and provides additional information for decision-making and uncertainty quantification through the use of quantiles when compared to conventional deep learning models.",

Hence, it is difficult to achieve high performance with existing deep-learning models as they require a massive labeled dataset to be trained effectively. An alternative solution is to use pre-trained models and fine-tune them using the medical imaging dataset. However, all existing models are pre-trained using natural images, which is a completely different domain from that of medical imaging, which leads to poor performance due to domain shift. To overcome these problems, we propose a large-scale unlabeled dataset of medical images and a backbone pre-trained using the proposed dataset with a self-supervised learning technique called Masked autoencoder. This backbone can be used as a pre-trained model for any medical imaging task, as it is trained to learn a visual representation of different types of medical images. To evaluate the performance of the proposed backbone, we used four different medical imaging tasks. The results are compared with existing pre-trained models. These experiments show the superiority of our proposed backbone in medical imaging tasks.",

A traditional medical image captioning model creates a medical description only based on a single medical image input. Hence, an abstract medical description or concept is hard to be generated based on the traditional approach. Such a method limits the effectiveness of medical image captioning. Multi-modal medical image captioning is one of the approaches utilized to address this problem. In multi-modal medical image captioning, textual input, e.g., expert-defined keywords, is considered as one of the main drivers of medical description generation. Thus, encoding the textual input and the medical image effectively are both important for the task of multi-modal medical image captioning. In this work, a new end-to-end deep multi-modal medical image captioning model is proposed. Contextualized keyword representations, textual feature reinforcement, and masked self-attention are used to develop the proposed approach. Based on the evaluation of the existing multi-modal medical image captioning dataset, experimental results show that the proposed model is effective with the increase of +53.2% in BLEU-avg and +18.6% in CIDEr, compared with the state-of-the-art method.",

To perform segmentation with limited number of labeled medical images, most existing studies use Proto-typical Networks (PN) and have obtained compelling success. However, these approaches overlook the query image features extracted from the proposed representation network, failing to preserving the spatial connection between query and support images. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised few-shot medical image segmentation network and introduce a novel Cycle-Resemblance Attention (CRA) module to fully leverage the pixel-wise relation between query and support medical images. Notably, we first line up multiple attention blocks to refine more abundant relation information. Then, we present CRAPNet by integrating the CRA module with a classic prototype network, where pixel-wise relations between query and support features are well recaptured for segmentation. Extensive experiments on two different medical image datasets, e.g., abdomen MRI and abdomen CT, demonstrate the superiority of our model over existing state-of-the-art methods.",

Although an array of adversarial training and/or loss function based defense techniques have been developed and proved to be effective in computer vision, defending against adversarial attacks on medical images remains largely an uncharted territory due to the following unique challenges: 1) label scarcity in medical images significantly limits adversarial generalizability of the AI system; 2) vastly similar and dominant fore- and background in medical images make it hard samples for learning the discriminating features between different disease classes; and 3) crafted adversarial noises added to the entire medical image as opposed to the focused organ target can make clean and adversarial examples more discriminate than that between different disease classes. In this paper, we propose a novel robust medical imaging AI framework based on Semi-Supervised Adversarial Training (SSAT) and Unsupervised Adversarial Detection (UAD), followed by designing a new measure for assessing systems adversarial risk. We systematically demonstrate the advantages of our robust medical imaging AI system over the existing adversarial defense techniques under diverse real-world settings of adversarial attacks using a benchmark OCT imaging data set.",

        "abstract": "The segmentation of medical images is a fundamental step in automated clinical decision support systems. Existing medical image segmentation methods based on supervised deep learning, however, remain problematic because of their reliance on large amounts of labelled training data. Although medical imaging data repositories continue to expand, there has not been a commensurate increase in the amount of annotated data. Hence, we propose a new spatial guided self-supervised clustering network (SGSCN) for medical image segmentation, where we introduce multiple loss functions designed to aid in grouping image pixels that are spatially connected and have similar feature representations. It iteratively learns feature representations and clustering assignment of each pixel in an end-to-end fashion from a single image. We also propose a context-based consistency loss that better delineates the shape and boundaries of image regions. It enforces all the pixels belonging to a cluster to be spatially close to the cluster centre. We evaluated our method on 2 public medical image datasets and compared it to existing conventional and self-supervised clustering methods. Experimental results show that our method was most accurate for medical image segmentation.",

Generative models offer a promising solution for addressing medical image shortage problems due to their ability to generate new data from existing datasets and detect anomalies in this data. Data augmentation with position augmentation methods like scaling, cropping, flipping, padding, rotation, and translation could lead to more overfitting in domains with little data, such as medical image data. This paper proposes the GAN-GA, a generative model optimized by embedding a genetic algorithm. The proposed model enhances image fidelity and diversity while preserving distinctive features. The proposed medical image synthesis approach improves the quality and fidelity of medical images, an essential aspect of image interpretation. To evaluate synthesized images: Frechet Inception Distance (FID) is used. The proposed GAN-GA model is tested by generating Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) medical images, an image dataset, and is the first time to be used in generative models. Our results were compared to those of InfoGAN as a baseline model. The experimental results show that the proposed optimized GAN-GA enhances FID scores by about 6.8\\%, especially in earlier training epochs.

Segmentation and classification approaches are mainly based on supervised learning with well-paired image-level or voxel-level labels. However, labeling the lesion in medical images is laborious requiring highly specialized knowledge. We propose a medical image synthesis model named abnormal-to-normal translation generative adversarial network (ANT-GAN) to generate a normal-looking medical image based on its abnormal-looking counterpart without the need for paired training data. Unlike typical GANs, whose aim is to generate realistic samples with variations, our more restrictive model aims at producing a normal-looking image corresponding to one containing lesions, and thus requires a special design. Being able to provide a \"normal\" counterpart to a medical image can provide useful side information for medical imaging tasks like lesion segmentation or classification validated by our experiments. In the other aspect, the ANT-GAN model is also capable of producing highly realistic lesion-containing image corresponding to the healthy one, which shows the potential in data augmentation verified in our experiments.",

This paper introduces a novel training-free evidential prompt generation method named EviPrompt to overcome these issues. The proposed method, built on the inherent similarities within medical images, requires only a single reference image-annotation pair, making it a training-free solution that significantly reduces the need for extensive labeling and computational resources. First, to automatically generate prompts for SAM in medical images, we introduce an evidential method based on uncertainty estimation without the interaction of clinical experts. Then, we incorporate the human prior into the prompts, which is vital for alleviating the domain gap between natural and medical images and enhancing the applicability and usefulness of SAM in medical scenarios. EviPrompt represents an efficient and robust approach to medical image segmentation, with evaluations across a broad range of tasks and modalities confirming its efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Due to the inherent flexibility of prompting, foundation models have emerged as the predominant force in the fields of natural language processing and computer vision. The recent introduction of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) signifies a noteworthy expansion of the prompt-driven paradigm into the domain of image segmentation, thereby introducing a plethora of previously unexplored capabilities. However, the viability of its application to medical image segmentation remains uncertain, given the substantial distinctions between natural and medical images. In this work, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent endeavors aimed at extending the efficacy of SAM to medical image segmentation tasks, encompassing both empirical benchmarking and methodological adaptations. Additionally, we explore potential avenues for future research directions in SAM's role within medical image segmentation. While direct application of SAM to medical image segmentation does not yield satisfactory performance on multi-modal and multi-target medical datasets so far, numerous insights gleaned from these efforts serve as valuable guidance for shaping the trajectory of foundational models in the realm of medical image analysis.

        "abstract": "Noisy labels can significantly impact medical image classification, particularly in deep learning, by corrupting learned features. Self-supervised pretraining, which doesn't rely on labeled data, can enhance robustness against noisy labels. However, this robustness varies based on factors like the number of classes, dataset complexity, and training size. In medical images, subtle inter-class differences and modality-specific characteristics add complexity. Previous research hasn't comprehensively explored the interplay between self-supervised learning and robustness against noisy labels in medical image classification, considering all these factors. In this study, we address three key questions: i) How does label noise impact various medical image classification datasets? ii) Which types of medical image datasets are more challenging to learn and more affected by label noise? iii) How do different self-supervised pretraining methods enhance robustness across various medical image datasets? Our results show that DermNet, among five datasets (Fetal plane, DermNet, COVID-DU-Ex, MURA, NCT-CRC-HE-100K), is the most challenging but exhibits greater robustness against noisy labels. Additionally, contrastive learning stands out among the eight self-supervised methods as the most effective approach to enhance robustness against noisy labels.",

Medical images contain rich anatomical divisions that could provide valuable local prior information to enhance the accuracy and robustness of INRs. In this work, we propose a novel framework, referred to as the Semantically Conditioned INR (SeCo-INR), that conditions an INR using local priors from a medical image, enabling accurate model fitting and interpolation capabilities to achieve super-resolution. Our framework learns a continuous representation of the semantic segmentation features of a medical image and utilizes it to derive the optimal INR for each semantic region of the image.

These methods primarily focus on estimating the suitability of pre-trained source model features for a target dataset, which can lead to unrealistic predictions, such as suggesting that the target dataset is the best source for itself. To address this, we propose a novel transferability metric that combines feature quality with gradients to evaluate both the suitability and adaptability of source model features for target tasks. We evaluate our approach in two new scenarios: source dataset transferability for medical image classification and cross-domain transferability. Our results show that our method outperforms existing transferability metrics in both settings. We also provide insight into the factors influencing transfer performance in medical image classification, as well as the dynamics of cross-domain transfer from natural to medical images.

However, their direct application to medical image segmentation poses several challenges. SSMs, originally designed for 1D sequences, struggle with 3D spatial structures in medical images due to discontinuities introduced by flattening. Additionally, SSMs have difficulty fitting high-variance data, which is common in medical imaging.   In this paper, we analyze the intrinsic limitations of SSMs in medical image segmentation and propose a unified U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture, Meta Mamba UNet (MM-UNet), designed to leverage the advantages of SSMs while mitigating their drawbacks. MM-UNet incorporates hybrid modules that integrate SSMs within residual connections, reducing variance and improving performance. Furthermore, we introduce a novel bi-directional scan order strategy to alleviate discontinuities when processing medical images.   Extensive experiments on the AMOS2022 and Synapse datasets demonstrate the superiority of MM-UNet over state-of-the-art methods. MM-UNet achieves a Dice score of 91.0% on AMOS2022, surpassing nnUNet by 3.2%, and a Dice score of 87.1% on Synapse.

Due to the presence of noise in image acquisition, registration researchers focused on an alternative way to represent medical images. An alternative way to analyze medical imaging is by understanding the 3D shapes represented in terms of point-cloud. Though in the medical imaging community, 3D point-cloud processing is not a ``go-to'' choice, it is a ``natural'' way to capture 3D shapes. However, as the number of samples for medical images are small, researchers have used pre-trained models to fine-tune on medical images. Furthermore, due to different modality in medical images, standard generative models can not be used to generate new samples of medical images. In this work, we use the advantage of point-cloud representation of 3D structures of medical images and propose a Gaussian mixture model-based generation scheme. Our proposed method is robust to outliers. Experimental validation has been performed to show that the proposed scheme can generate new 3D structures using interpolation techniques, i.e., given two 3D structures represented as point-clouds, we can generate point-clouds in between. We have also generated new point-clouds for subjects with and without dementia and show that the generated samples are indeed closely matched to the respective training samples from the same class.",

CNN has great advantages in extracting local features of images. However, due to the locality of convolution operation, it can not deal with long-range relationships well. Recently, transformers have been applied to computer vision and achieved remarkable success in large-scale datasets. Compared with natural images, multi-modal medical images have explicit and important long-range dependencies, and effective multi-modal fusion strategies can greatly improve the performance of deep models. This prompts us to study transformer-based structures and apply them to multi-modal medical images. Existing transformer-based network architectures require large-scale datasets to achieve better performance. However, medical imaging datasets are relatively small, which makes it difficult to apply pure transformers to medical image analysis. Therefore, we propose TransMed for multi-modal medical image classification. TransMed combines the advantages of CNN and transformer to efficiently extract low-level features of images and establish long-range dependencies between modalities. We evaluated our model for the challenging problem of preoperative diagnosis of parotid gland tumors, and the experimental results show the advantages of our proposed method. We argue that the combination of CNN and transformer has tremendous potential in a large number of medical image analysis tasks.

Supervised learning using convolutional neural networks (CNN) provides state-of-the-art performance and has served as a benchmark for various medical image segmentation and classification. However, supervised learning deeply relies on large-scale annotated data, which is expensive, time-consuming, and even impractical to acquire in medical imaging applications. Active Learning (AL) methods have been widely applied in natural image classification tasks to reduce annotation costs by selecting more valuable examples from the unlabeled data pool. However, their application in medical image segmentation tasks is limited, and there is currently no effective and universal AL-based method specifically designed for 3D medical image segmentation. To address this limitation, we propose an AL-based method that can be simultaneously applied to 2D medical image classification, segmentation, and 3D medical image segmentation tasks. We extensively validated our proposed active learning method on three publicly available and challenging medical image datasets, Kvasir Dataset, COVID-19 Infection Segmentation Dataset, and BraTS2019 Dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our PCDAL can achieve significantly improved performance with fewer annotations in 2D classification and segmentation and 3D segmentation tasks.

        "abstract": "Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) has shown the merits of analysing medical images, by leveraging the semantic congruence between medical images and their corresponding reports. It efficiently learns visual representations, which in turn facilitates enhanced analysis and interpretation of intricate imaging data. However, such observation is predominantly justified on single-modality data (mostly 2D images like X-rays), adapting VLP to learning unified representations for medical images in real scenario remains an open challenge. This arises from medical images often encompass a variety of modalities, especially modalities with different various number of dimensions (e.g., 3D images like Computed Tomography). To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we propose an Unified Medical Image Pre-training framework, namely UniMedI, which utilizes diagnostic reports as common semantic space to create unified representations for diverse modalities of medical images (especially for 2D and 3D images). Under the text's guidance, we effectively uncover visual modality information, identifying the affected areas in 2D X-rays and slices containing lesion in sophisticated 3D CT scans, ultimately enhancing the consistency across various medical imaging modalities. To demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of UniMedI, we evaluate its performance on both 2D and 3D images across 10 different datasets, covering a wide range of medical image tasks such as classification, segmentation, and retrieval. UniMedI has demonstrated superior performance in downstream tasks, showcasing its effectiveness in establishing a universal medical visual representation.",

        "abstract": "In the field of medical decision-making, precise anomaly detection in medical imaging plays a pivotal role in aiding clinicians. However, previous work is reliant on large-scale datasets for training anomaly detection models, which increases the development cost. This paper first focuses on the task of medical image anomaly detection in the few-shot setting, which is critically significant for the medical field where data collection and annotation are both very expensive. We propose an innovative approach, MediCLIP, which adapts the CLIP model to few-shot medical image anomaly detection through self-supervised fine-tuning. Although CLIP, as a vision-language model, demonstrates outstanding zero-/fewshot performance on various downstream tasks, it still falls short in the anomaly detection of medical images. To address this, we design a series of medical image anomaly synthesis tasks to simulate common disease patterns in medical imaging, transferring the powerful generalization capabilities of CLIP to the task of medical image anomaly detection. When only few-shot normal medical images are provided, MediCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection and location compared to other methods. Extensive experiments on three distinct medical anomaly detection tasks have demonstrated the superiority of our approach. The code is available at https://github.com/cnulab/MediCLIP.",

        "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) requires a large amount of training data to provide quality outcomes. However, the field of medical imaging suffers from the lack of sufficient data for properly training DL models because medical images require manual labelling carried out by clinical experts thus the process is time-consuming, expensive, and error-prone. Recently, transfer learning (TL) was introduced to reduce the need for the annotation procedure by means of transferring the knowledge performed by a previous task and then fine-tuning the result using a relatively small dataset. Nowadays, multiple classification methods from medical imaging make use of TL from general-purpose pre-trained models, e.g., ImageNet, which has been proven to be ineffective due to the mismatch between the features learned from natural images (ImageNet) and those more specific from medical images especially medical gray images such as X-rays. ImageNet does not have grayscale images such as MRI, CT, and X-ray. In this paper, we propose a novel DL model to be used for addressing classification tasks of medical imaging, called MedNet. To do so, we aim to issue two versions of MedNet. The first one is Gray-MedNet which will be trained on 3M publicly available gray-scale medical images including MRI, CT, X-ray, ultrasound, and PET. The second version is Color-MedNet which will be trained on 3M publicly available color medical images including histopathology, taken images, and many others. To validate the effectiveness MedNet, both versions will be fine-tuned to train on the target tasks of a more reduced set of medical images. MedNet performs as the pre-trained model to tackle any real-world application from medical imaging and achieve the level of generalization needed for dealing with medical imaging tasks, e.g. classification. MedNet would serve the research community as a baseline for future research.",

In the PMI framework, computational experiments with predictive learning in a data-driven way are conducted to extract medical knowledge for diagnostic decision support. Artificial imaging systems are introduced to select and prescriptively generate medical image data in a knowledge-driven way to utilize medical domain knowledge. Through the closed-loop optimization based on parallel execution, our proposed PMI framework can boost the generalization ability and alleviate the limitation of medical interpretation for diagnostic decisions. Furthermore, we illustrate the preliminary implementation of PMI method through the case studies of mammogram analysis and skin lesion image analysis.

Yet, no large-scale evaluation has been conducted to benchmark the efficacy of newly-developed pre-training techniques for medical image analysis, leaving several important questions unanswered. As the first step in this direction, we conduct a systematic study on the transferability of models pre-trained on iNat2021, the most recent large-scale fine-grained dataset, and 14 top self-supervised ImageNet models on 7 diverse medical tasks in comparison with the supervised ImageNet model. Furthermore, we present a practical approach to bridge the domain gap between natural and medical images by continually (pre-)training supervised ImageNet models on medical images. Our comprehensive evaluation yields new insights: (1) pre-trained models on fine-grained data yield distinctive local representations that are more suitable for medical segmentation tasks, (2) self-supervised ImageNet models learn holistic features more effectively than supervised ImageNet models, and (3) continual pre-training can bridge the domain gap between natural and medical images. We hope that this large-scale open evaluation of transfer learning can direct the future research of deep learning for medical imaging.

        "abstract": "Human organs constantly undergo anatomical changes due to a complex mix of short-term (e.g., heartbeat) and long-term (e.g., aging) factors. Evidently, prior knowledge of these factors will be beneficial when modeling their future state, i.e., via image generation. However, most of the medical image generation tasks only rely on the input from a single image, thus ignoring the sequential dependency even when longitudinal data is available. Sequence-aware deep generative models, where model input is a sequence of ordered and timestamped images, are still underexplored in the medical imaging domain that is featured by several unique challenges: 1) Sequences with various lengths; 2) Missing data or frame, and 3) High dimensionality. To this end, we propose a sequence-aware diffusion model (SADM) for the generation of longitudinal medical images. Recently, diffusion models have shown promising results in high-fidelity image generation. Our method extends this new technique by introducing a sequence-aware transformer as the conditional module in a diffusion model. The novel design enables learning longitudinal dependency even with missing data during training and allows autoregressive generation of a sequence of images during inference. Our extensive experiments on 3D longitudinal medical images demonstrate the effectiveness of SADM compared with baselines and alternative methods.

The brute-force approach for finding the nearest neighbor becomes computationally infeasible when the number of points is large. The NNS has multiple applications in medicine, such as searching large medical imaging databases, disease classification, diagnosis, etc. With a focus on medical imaging, this paper proposes DenseLinkSearch an effective and efficient algorithm that searches and retrieves the relevant images from heterogeneous sources of medical images. Towards this, given a medical database, the proposed algorithm builds the index that consists of pre-computed links of each point in the database. The search algorithm utilizes the index to efficiently traverse the database in search of the nearest neighbor. We extensively tested the proposed NNS approach and compared the performance with state-of-the-art NNS approaches on benchmark datasets and our created medical image datasets. The proposed approach outperformed the existing approach in terms of retrieving accurate neighbors and retrieval speed. We also explore the role of medical image feature representation in content-based medical image retrieval tasks. We propose a Transformer-based feature representation technique that outperformed the existing pre-trained Transformer approach on CLEF 2011 medical image retrieval task.

        "abstract": "Large-scale medical imaging datasets have accelerated deep learning (DL) for medical image analysis. However, the large scale of these datasets poses a challenge for researchers, resulting in increased storage and bandwidth requirements for hosting and accessing them. Since different researchers have different use cases and require different resolutions or formats for DL, it is neither feasible to anticipate every researcher's needs nor practical to store data in multiple resolutions and formats. To that end, we propose the Medical Image Streaming Toolkit (MIST), a format-agnostic database that enables streaming of medical images at different resolutions and formats from a single high-resolution copy. We evaluated MIST across eight popular, large-scale medical imaging datasets spanning different body parts, modalities, and formats. Our results showed that our framework reduced the storage and bandwidth requirements for hosting and downloading datasets without impacting image quality. We demonstrate that MIST addresses the challenges posed by large-scale medical imaging datasets by building a data-efficient and format-agnostic database to meet the diverse needs of researchers and reduce barriers to DL research in medical imaging.",

        "abstract": "In the face of rapid advances in medical imaging, cross-domain adaptive medical image detection is challenging due to the differences in lesion representations across various medical imaging technologies. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from large language models to propose EAFP-Med, an efficient adaptive feature processing module based on prompts for medical image detection. EAFP-Med can efficiently extract lesion features of different scales from a diverse range of medical images based on prompts while being flexible and not limited by specific imaging techniques. Furthermore, it serves as a feature preprocessing module that can be connected to any model front-end to enhance the lesion features in input images. Moreover, we propose a novel adaptive disease detection model named EAFP-Med ST, which utilizes the Swin Transformer V2 - Tiny (SwinV2-T) as its backbone and connects it to EAFP-Med. We have compared our method to nine state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate that EAFP-Med ST achieves the best performance on all three datasets (chest X-ray images, cranial magnetic resonance imaging images, and skin images). EAFP-Med can efficiently extract lesion features from various medical images based on prompts, enhancing the model's performance. This holds significant potential for improving medical image analysis and diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Data scarcity and privacy concerns limit the availability of high-quality medical images for public use, which can be mitigated through medical image synthesis. However, current medical image synthesis methods often struggle to accurately capture the complexity of detailed anatomical structures and pathological conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel medical image synthesis model that leverages fine-grained image-text alignment and anatomy-pathology prompts to generate highly detailed and accurate synthetic medical images. Our method integrates advanced natural language processing techniques with image generative modeling, enabling precise alignment between descriptive text prompts and the synthesized images' anatomical and pathological details. The proposed approach consists of two key components: an anatomy-pathology prompting module and a fine-grained alignment-based synthesis module. The anatomy-pathology prompting module automatically generates descriptive prompts for high-quality medical images. To further synthesize high-quality medical images from the generated prompts, the fine-grained alignment-based synthesis module pre-defines a visual codebook for the radiology dataset and performs fine-grained alignment between the codebook and generated prompts to obtain key patches as visual clues, facilitating accurate image synthesis. We validate the superiority of our method through experiments on public chest X-ray datasets and demonstrate that our synthetic images preserve accurate semantic information, making them valuable for various medical applications.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of learning from positive and unlabeled examples (PU learning), particularly in the context of advancing image and text classification tasks. However, applying PU learning to semi-supervised disease classification remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the limited availability of labeled medical images. In the realm of medical image-aided diagnosis algorithms, numerous theoretical and practical obstacles persist. The research on PU learning for medical image-assisted diagnosis holds substantial importance, as it aims to reduce the time spent by professional experts in classifying images. Unlike natural images, medical images are typically accompanied by a scarcity of annotated data, while an abundance of unlabeled cases exists. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces a novel generative model inspired by H\\\"older divergence, specifically designed for semi-supervised disease classification using positive and unlabeled medical image data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive formulation of the problem and establish its theoretical feasibility through rigorous mathematical analysis. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets commonly used in PU medical learning: BreastMNIST, PneumoniaMNIST, BloodMNIST, OCTMNIST, and AMD. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches based on KL divergence. Notably, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all five disease classification benchmarks.   By addressing the limitations imposed by limited labeled data and harnessing the untapped potential of unlabeled medical images, our novel generative model presents a promising direction for enhancing semi-supervised disease classification in the field of medical image analysis.",

Recent studies demonstrate that vision transformer-based methods have significantly improved performance in medical image segmentation, primarily due to their superior ability to establish global relationships among features and adaptability to various inputs. However, these methods struggle with the low signal-to-noise ratio inherent to medical images. Additionally, the effective utilization of channel and spatial information, which are essential for medical image segmentation, is limited by the representation capacity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-dimension transformer with attention-based filtering (MDT-AF), which redesigns the patch embedding and self-attention mechanism for medical image segmentation. MDT-AF incorporates an attention-based feature filtering mechanism into the patch embedding blocks and employs a coarse-to-fine process to mitigate the impact of low signal-to-noise ratio. To better capture complex structures in medical images, MDT-AF extends the self-attention mechanism to incorporate spatial and channel dimensions, enriching feature representation. Moreover, we introduce an interaction mechanism to improve the feature aggregation between spatial and channel dimensions. Experimental results on three public medical image segmentation benchmarks show that MDT-AF achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.",

The current body of survey literature on foundation models in medical imaging reveals considerable gaps, particularly in the area of trustworthiness. Additionally, existing surveys on the trustworthiness of foundation models do not adequately address their specific variations and applications within the medical imaging domain. This survey aims to fill that gap by presenting a novel taxonomy of foundation models used in medical imaging and analyzing the key motivations for ensuring their trustworthiness. We review current research on foundation models in major medical imaging applications, focusing on segmentation, medical report generation, medical question and answering (Q\\&A), and disease diagnosis. These areas are highlighted because they have seen a relatively mature and substantial number of foundation models compared to other applications. We focus on literature that discusses trustworthiness in medical image analysis manuscripts. We explore the complex challenges of building trustworthy foundation models for each application, summarizing current concerns and strategies for enhancing trustworthiness. Furthermore, we examine the potential of these models to revolutionize patient care. Our analysis underscores the imperative for advancing towards trustworthy AI in medical image analysis, advocating for a balanced approach that fosters innovation while ensuring ethical and equitable healthcare delivery.",

        "abstract": "Producing high-quality segmentation masks for medical images is a fundamental challenge in biomedical image analysis. Recent research has explored large-scale supervised training to enable segmentation across various medical imaging modalities and unsupervised training to facilitate segmentation without dense annotations. However, constructing a model capable of segmenting diverse medical images in a zero-shot manner without any annotations remains a significant hurdle. This paper introduces the Attention Diffusion Zero-shot Unsupervised System (ADZUS), a novel approach that leverages self-attention diffusion models for zero-shot biomedical image segmentation. ADZUS harnesses the intrinsic capabilities of pre-trained diffusion models, utilizing their generative and discriminative potentials to segment medical images without requiring annotated training data or prior domain-specific knowledge. The ADZUS architecture is detailed, with its integration of self-attention mechanisms that facilitate context-aware and detail-sensitive segmentations being highlighted. Experimental results across various medical imaging datasets, including skin lesion segmentation, chest X-ray infection segmentation, and white blood cell segmentation, reveal that ADZUS achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, ADZUS reached Dice scores ranging from 88.7\\% to 92.9\\% and IoU scores from 66.3\\% to 93.3\\% across different segmentation tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in handling novel, unseen medical imagery. It is noteworthy that while ADZUS demonstrates high effectiveness, it demands substantial computational resources and extended processing times. The model's efficacy in zero-shot settings underscores its potential to reduce reliance on costly annotations and seamlessly adapt to new medical imaging tasks, thereby expanding the diagnostic capabilities of AI-driven medical imaging technologies.",

However, current research on optimization algorithms in federated learning often focuses on limited datasets and scenarios, primarily centered around natural images, with insufficient comparative experiments in medical contexts. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of several state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms in the context of medical imaging. We conduct a fair comparison of classification models trained using various federated learning algorithms across multiple medical imaging datasets. Additionally, we evaluate system performance metrics, such as communication cost and computational efficiency, while considering different federated learning architectures. Our findings show that medical imaging datasets pose substantial challenges for current federated learning optimization algorithms. No single algorithm consistently delivers optimal performance across all medical federated learning scenarios, and many optimization algorithms may underperform when applied to these datasets. Our experiments provide a benchmark and guidance for future research and application of federated learning in medical imaging contexts. Furthermore, we propose an efficient and robust method that combines generative techniques using denoising diffusion probabilistic models with label smoothing to augment datasets, widely enhancing the performance of federated learning on classification tasks across various medical imaging datasets. Our code will be released on GitHub, offering a reliable and comprehensive benchmark for future federated learning studies in medical imaging.",

Recently, a large body of research has studied the problem of medical image segmentation with imperfect datasets, tackling two major dataset limitations: scarce annotations where only limited annotated data is available for training, and weak annotations where the training data has only sparse annotations, noisy annotations, or image-level annotations. In this article, we provide a detailed review of the solutions above, summarizing both the technical novelties and empirical results. We further compare the benefits and requirements of the surveyed methodologies and provide our recommended solutions.

The MapReduce framework is used to speed up and make possible three large-scale medical image processing use-cases: (i) parameter optimization for lung texture segmentation using support vector machines, (ii) content-based medical image indexing, and (iii) three-dimensional directional wavelet analysis for solid texture classification. A cluster of heterogeneous computing nodes was set up in our institution using Hadoop allowing for a maximum of 42 concurrent map tasks. The majority of the machines used are desktop computers that are also used for regular office work. The cluster showed to be minimally invasive and stable. The runtimes of each of the three use-case have been significantly reduced when compared to a sequential execution. Hadoop provides an easy-to-employ framework for data analysis tasks that scales well for many tasks but requires optimization for specific tasks.",

        "abstract": "Currently there is strong interest in data-driven approaches to medical image classification. However, medical imaging data is scarce, expensive, and fraught with legal concerns regarding patient privacy. Typical consent forms only allow for patient data to be used in medical journals or education, meaning the majority of medical data is inaccessible for general public research. We propose a novel, two-stage pipeline for generating synthetic medical images from a pair of generative adversarial networks, tested in practice on retinal fundi images. We develop a hierarchical generation process to divide the complex image generation task into two parts: geometry and photorealism. We hope researchers will use our pipeline to bring private medical data into the public domain, sparking growth in imaging tasks that have previously relied on the hand-tuning of models. We have begun this initiative through the development of SynthMed, an online repository for synthetic medical images.",

This necessitates compact storage of medical images before being transmitted over Internet. Moreover, as the patient information is also embedded within the medical images, it is very important to maintain the confidentiality of patient data.

To perform well on a given task, these algorithms require large dataset for training. However, deep learning algorithms lack generalization and suffer from over-fitting whenever trained on small dataset, especially when one is dealing with medical images. For supervised image analysis in medical imaging, having image data along with their corresponding annotated ground-truths is costly as well as time consuming since annotations of the data is done by medical experts manually. In this paper, we propose a new Generative Adversarial Network for Medical Imaging (MI-GAN). The MI-GAN generates synthetic medical images and their segmented masks, which can then be used for the application of supervised analysis of medical images. Particularly, we present MI-GAN for synthesis of retinal images. The proposed method generates precise segmented images better than the existing techniques.

        "abstract": "With the development of deep learning, medical image classification has been significantly improved. However, deep learning requires massive data with labels. While labeling the samples by human experts is expensive and time-consuming, collecting labels from crowd-sourcing suffers from the noises which may degenerate the accuracy of classifiers. Therefore, approaches that can effectively handle label noises are highly desired. Unfortunately, recent progress on handling label noise in deep learning has gone largely unnoticed by the medical image. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a noise-tolerant medical image classification framework named Co-Correcting, which significantly improves classification accuracy and obtains more accurate labels through dual-network mutual learning, label probability estimation, and curriculum label correcting. On two representative medical image datasets and the MNIST dataset, we test six latest Learning-with-Noisy-Labels methods and conduct comparative studies. The experiments show that Co-Correcting achieves the best accuracy and generalization under different noise ratios in various tasks.

        "abstract": "With a widespread use of digital imaging data in hospitals, the size of medical image repositories is increasing rapidly. This causes difficulty in managing and querying these large databases leading to the need of content based medical image retrieval (CBMIR) systems. A major challenge in CBMIR systems is the semantic gap that exists between the low level visual information captured by imaging devices and high level semantic information perceived by human. The efficacy of such systems is more crucial in terms of feature representations that can characterize the high-level information completely. In this paper, we propose a framework of deep learning for CBMIR system by using deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that is trained for classification of medical images. An intermodal dataset that contains twenty four classes and five modalities is used to train the network. The learned features and the classification results are used to retrieve medical images. For retrieval, best results are achieved when class based predictions are used. An average classification accuracy of 99.77% and a mean average precision of 0.69 is achieved for retrieval task. The proposed method is best suited to retrieve multimodal medical images for different body organs.",

Differences between image types are primarily due to the imaging modality and medical images utilize a wide range of physics based techniques while natural images are captured using only visible light. While many have demonstrated that SSL on medical images has resulted in better downstream task performance, our work suggests that more performance can be gained. The scientific principles which are used to acquire medical images are not often considered when constructing learning problems. For this reason, we propose incorporating quantitative imaging principles during generative SSL to improve image quality and quantitative biological accuracy. We show that this training schema results in better starting states for downstream supervised training on limited data. Our model also generates images that validate on clinical quantitative analysis software.",

The latent spaces of these models often show semantically meaningful directions corresponding to human-interpretable image transformations. However, until now, their exploration for medical images has been limited due to the requirement of supervised data. Several methods for unsupervised discovery of interpretable directions in GAN latent spaces have shown interesting results on natural images. This work explores the potential of applying these techniques on medical images by training a GAN and a VAE on thoracic CT scans and using an unsupervised method to discover interpretable directions in the resulting latent space. We find several directions corresponding to non-trivial image transformations, such as rotation or breast size. Furthermore, the directions show that the generative models capture 3D structure despite being presented only with 2D data. The results show that unsupervised methods to discover interpretable directions in GANs generalize to VAEs and can be applied to medical images. This opens a wide array of future work using these methods in medical image analysis.",

        "abstract": "Medical imaging is an essential tool for diagnosing various healthcare diseases and conditions. However, analyzing medical images is a complex and time-consuming task that requires expertise and experience. This article aims to design a decision support system to assist healthcare providers and patients in making decisions about diagnosing, treating, and managing health conditions. The proposed architecture contains three stages: 1) data collection and labeling, 2) model training, and 3) diagnosis report generation. The key idea is to train a deep learning model on a medical image dataset to extract four types of information: the type of image scan, the body part, the test image, and the results. This information is then fed into ChatGPT to generate automatic diagnostics. The proposed system has the potential to enhance decision-making, reduce costs, and improve the capabilities of healthcare providers. The efficacy of the proposed system is analyzed by conducting extensive experiments on a large medical image dataset. The experimental outcomes exhibited promising performance for automatic diagnosis through medical images.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning-based medical image segmentation studies achieve nearly human-level performance in fully supervised manner. However, acquiring pixel-level expert annotations is extremely expensive and laborious in medical imaging fields. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) can alleviate this problem, which makes it possible to use annotated data in one imaging modality to train a network that can successfully perform segmentation on target imaging modality with no labels. In this work, we propose SDC-UDA, a simple yet effective volumetric UDA framework for slice-direction continuous cross-modality medical image segmentation which combines intra- and inter-slice self-attentive image translation, uncertainty-constrained pseudo-label refinement, and volumetric self-training. Our method is distinguished from previous methods on UDA for medical image segmentation in that it can obtain continuous segmentation in the slice direction, thereby ensuring higher accuracy and potential in clinical practice. We validate SDC-UDA with multiple publicly available cross-modality medical image segmentation datasets and achieve state-of-the-art segmentation performance, not to mention the superior slice-direction continuity of prediction compared to previous studies.",

        "abstract": "Transfer learning is a critical technique in training deep neural networks for the challenging medical image segmentation task that requires enormous resources. With the abundance of medical image data, many research institutions release models trained on various datasets that can form a huge pool of candidate source models to choose from. Hence, it's vital to estimate the source models' transferability (i.e., the ability to generalize across different downstream tasks) for proper and efficient model reuse. To make up for its deficiency when applying transfer learning to medical image segmentation, in this paper, we therefore propose a new Transferability Estimation (TE) method. We first analyze the drawbacks of using the existing TE algorithms for medical image segmentation and then design a source-free TE framework that considers both class consistency and feature variety for better estimation. Extensive experiments show that our method surpasses all current algorithms for transferability estimation in medical image segmentation.

        "abstract": "Medical image segmentation has made significant progress when a large amount of labeled data are available. However, annotating medical image segmentation datasets is expensive due to the requirement of professional skills. Additionally, classes are often unevenly distributed in medical images, which severely affects the classification performance on minority classes. To address these problems, this paper proposes Co-Distribution Alignment (Co-DA) for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Specifically, Co-DA aligns marginal predictions on unlabeled data to marginal predictions on labeled data in a class-wise manner with two differently initialized models before using the pseudo-labels generated by one model to supervise the other. Besides, we design an over-expectation cross-entropy loss for filtering the unlabeled pixels to reduce noise in their pseudo-labels. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods on both the 2D CaDIS dataset and the 3D LGE-MRI and ACDC datasets, achieving an mIoU of 0.8515 with only 24% labeled data on CaDIS, and a Dice score of 0.8824 and 0.8773 with only 20% data on LGE-MRI and ACDC, respectively.",

In initial phase of research, major focus has been given to review existing deep-learning approaches, including researches like MultiResUNet, Attention U-Net, classical U-Net, and other variants. The attention feature vectors or maps dynamically add important weights to critical information, and most of these variants use these to increase accuracy, but the network parameter requirements are somewhat more stringent. They face certain problems such as overfitting, as their number of trainable parameters is very high, and so is their inference time.

However, these models often fail to generalize on the free-hand sketches, leading to unsatisfactory results. In this paper, we propose a practical free-hand sketch-to-image generation model called Sketch2MedI that learns to represent sketches in StyleGAN's latent space and generate medical images from it.

Our Sketch2MedI demonstrates a robust generalization to free-hand sketches, resulting in high-quality and realistic medical image generations. Comparative evaluations of Sketch2MedI against the pix2pix, CycleGAN, UNIT, and U-GAT-IT models show superior performance in generating pharyngeal images, both quantitative and qualitative across various metrics.",

        "abstract": "Recently, machine learning-based semantic segmentation algorithms have demonstrated their potential to accurately segment regions and contours in medical images, allowing the precise location of anatomical structures and abnormalities. Although medical images are difficult to acquire and annotate, semi-supervised learning methods are efficient in dealing with the scarcity of labeled data. However, overfitting is almost inevitable due to the limited images for training. Furthermore, the intricate shapes of organs and lesions in medical images introduce additional complexity in different cases, preventing networks from acquiring a strong ability to generalize. To this end, we introduce a novel method called Scaling-up Mix with Multi-Class (SM2C). This method uses three strategies - scaling-up image size, multi-class mixing, and object shape jittering - to improve the ability to learn semantic features within medical images. By diversifying the shape of the segmentation objects and enriching the semantic information within each sample, the SM2C demonstrates its potential, especially in the training of unlabelled data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the SM2C on three benchmark medical image segmentation datasets. The proposed framework shows significant improvements over state-of-the-art counterparts.",

        "abstract": "Unlike typical visual scene recognition domains, in which massive datasets are accessible to deep neural networks, medical image interpretations are often obstructed by the paucity of data. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of data-based few-shot learning in medical imaging by exploring different data attribute representations in a low-dimensional space. We introduce different types of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) in few-shot learning, addressing the data scarcity issue in medical image classification. Extensive empirical studies are conducted in terms of validating the effectiveness of NMF, especially its supervised variants (e.g., discriminative NMF, and supervised and constrained NMF with sparseness), and the comparison with principal component analysis (PCA), i.e., the collaborative representation-based dimensionality reduction technique derived from eigenvectors. With 14 different datasets covering 11 distinct illness categories, thorough experimental results and comparison with related techniques demonstrate that NMF is a competitive alternative to PCA for few-shot learning in medical imaging, and the supervised NMF algorithms are more discriminative in the subspace with greater effectiveness. Furthermore, we show that the part-based representation of NMF, especially its supervised variants, is dramatically impactful in detecting lesion areas in medical imaging with limited samples.",

        "abstract": "In the age of digital technology, medical images play a crucial role in the healthcare industry which aids surgeons in making precise decisions and reducing the diagnosis time. However, the storage of large amounts of these images in third-party cloud services raises privacy and security concerns. There are a lot of classical security mechanisms to protect them. Although, the advent of quantum computing entails the development of quantum-based encryption models for healthcare. Hence, we introduce a novel quantum chaos-based encryption scheme for medical images in this article. The model comprises bit-plane scrambling, quantum logistic map, quantum operations in the diffusion phase and hybrid chaotic map, DNA encoding, and computations in the confusion phase to transform the plain medical image into a cipher medical image. The proposed scheme has been evaluated using multiple statistical measures and validated against more attacks such as differential attacks with three different medical datasets. Hence the introduced encryption model has proved to be attack-resistant and robust than other existing image encryption schemes, ensuring the secure storage of medical images in cloud environments.",

        "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures and abnormalities in medical images is crucial for computer-aided diagnosis and analysis. While deep learning techniques excel at this task, their computational demands pose challenges. Additionally, some cutting-edge segmentation methods, though effective for general object segmentation, may not be optimised for medical images. To address these issues, we propose Mini-Net, a lightweight segmentation network specifically designed for medical images. With fewer than 38,000 parameters, Mini-Net efficiently captures both high- and low-frequency features, enabling real-time applications in various medical imaging scenarios. We evaluate Mini-Net on various datasets, including DRIVE, STARE, ISIC-2016, ISIC-2018, and MoNuSeg, demonstrating its robustness and good performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

While numerous state-of-the-art Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) architectures are renowned for their proficient feature extraction, this paper investigates their efficacy in the context of medical image deepfake detection. The primary objective is to effectively distinguish real from tampered or manipulated medical images by employing a comprehensive evaluation of 13 state-of-the-art DCNNs. Performance is assessed across diverse evaluation metrics, encompassing considerations of time efficiency and computational resource requirements. Our findings reveal that ResNet50V2 excels in precision and specificity, whereas DenseNet169 is distinguished by its accuracy, recall, and F1-score. We investigate the specific scenarios in which one model would be more favorable than another. Additionally, MobileNetV3Large offers competitive performance, emerging as the swiftest among the considered DCNN models while maintaining a relatively small parameter count. We also assess the latent space separability quality across the examined DCNNs, showing superiority in both the DenseNet and EfficientNet model families and entailing a higher understanding of medical image deepfakes. The experimental analysis in this research contributes valuable insights to the field of deepfake image detection in the medical imaging domain.",

While ample research on mathematical modeling education and published textbooks on the topic are available, there is a lack of focus on mathematical modeling for sustainability. This review aims to address this gap by exploring the powerful intersection of mathematical modeling and sustainability. Mathematical modeling for sustainability connects two distinct realms: learning about the mathematics of sustainability and promoting sustainable learning in mathematics education. The former involves teaching and learning sustainability quantitatively, while the latter encompasses pedagogy that enables learners to apply quantitative knowledge and skills to everyday life and continue learning and improving mathematically beyond formal education. To demonstrate the practical application of mathematical modeling for sustainability, we discuss a specific textbook suitable for a pilot liberal arts course. We illustrate how learners can grasp mathematical concepts related to sustainability through simple yet mathematically diverse examples, which can be further developed for teaching such a course. Indeed, by filling the gap in the literature and providing practical resources, this review contributes to the advancement of mathematical modeling education in the context of sustainability.",

The term 'humanizing mathematics' which includes elements of 'aesthetic mathematics' refers to approaches that emphasize the aesthetic, philosophical, and subjective dimensions of mathematics. These approaches aim to make mathematics humanize. It proposes novel directions in mathematics, stressing that the ideas presented here are provisional. Furthermore, it argues that mathematics can take multiple humanized forms. Even traditional mathematics can be interpreted as a form of humanized mathematics. To support this perspective, several mathematical observations are provided. Additionally, a general approach to addressing the Riemann Hypothesis, focusing on proof by contradiction and mathematical logic, particularly model theory, is outlined. The paper also briefly reflects on my prior research through this idea on humanization and concludes with general remarks and future directions.",

        "abstract": "Discrete Euclidian Spaces (DESs) are the beginning of a journey without return towards the discretization of mathematics. Important mathematical concepts- such as the idea of number or the systems of numeration, whose formal definition is currently independent of Euclidean spaces -have in the Isodimensional Discrete Mathematics (IDM) their roots in the DESs. This mathematics, which arises largely from the discretization of traditional mathematics, presents its foundations and concepts differently from the orthodox way, so at first glance it may seem that the IDM could be an exotic tool, or perhaps just \"a simple curiosity.\" However, the IDM dis-crete approaches have a great theoretical repercussion on traditional mathematics.",

We give an account of what warrants mathematical representation of phenomenal experience, derive a general mathematical framework which takes into account consciousness' epistemic context and study which mathematical structures some of the key characteristics of conscious experience imply, showing precisely where mathematical approaches allow to go beyond what the standard methodology can do. The result is a general mathematical framework for models of consciousness that can be employed in the theory-building process.",

Our Project began with the development of a program that can be used to generate invariant-relation and property-relation conjectures in many areas of mathematics. This program can produce conjectures which are not implied by existing (published) theorems. Here we propose a new approach to push forward existing mathematical research goals---using automated mathematical discovery software. We suggest how to initiate and harness large-scale collaborative mathematics. We envision mathematical research labs similar to what exist in other sciences, new avenues for funding, new opportunities for training students, and a more efficient and effective use of published mathematical research.   And our experiment in graph theory can be imitated in many other areas of mathematical research. Big Mathematics is the idea of large, systematic, collaborative research on problems of existing mathematical interest. What is possible when we put our skills, tools, and results together systematically?",

Foundations of mathematics of this type fail to satisfactory perform more basic and more practically-oriented functions of theoretical foundations such as verification of mathematical constructions and proofs. Using alternative foundations of mathematics such as the Univalent Foundations is compatible with using the received set-theoretic foundations for meta-mathematical purposes provided the two foundations are mutually interpretable. Changes in foundations of mathematics do not, generally, disqualify mathematical theories based on older foundations but allow for reconstruction of these theories on new foundations.

Recent works on mathematical language focus either on representing stand-alone mathematical expressions, especially in their natural tree format, or mathematical reasoning in pre-trained natural language models. Existing works on jointly modeling and generating natural and mathematical languages simply treat mathematical expressions as text, without accounting for the rigid structural properties of mathematical expressions. In this paper, we propose a series of modifications to existing language models to jointly represent and generate text and math: representing mathematical expressions as sequences of node tokens in their operator tree format, using math symbol and tree position embeddings to preserve the semantic and structural properties of mathematical expressions, and using a constrained decoding method to generate mathematically valid expressions. We ground our modifications in GPT-2, resulting in a model MathGPT, and demonstrate that it outperforms baselines on mathematical expression generation tasks.",

As a result, the artificial intelligence discovered market manipulation as an optimal investment strategy.

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence applications gradually move outside the safe walls of research labs and invade our daily lives. This is also true for Machine Learning methods on Knowledge Graphs, which has led to a steady increase in their application since the beginning of the 21st century. However, in many applications, users require an explanation of the Artificial Intelligences decision. This led to increased demand for Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence. Knowledge Graphs epitomize fertile soil for Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence, due to their ability to display connected data, i.e. knowledge, in a human- as well as machine-readable way. This survey gives a short history to Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs. Furthermore, we contribute by arguing that the concept Explainable Artificial Intelligence is overloaded and overlapping with Interpretable Machine Learning. By introducing the parent concept Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence, we provide a clear-cut distinction of both concepts while accounting for their similarities. Thus, we provide in this survey a case for Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs consisting of Interpretable Machine Learning on Knowledge Graphs and Explainable Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs. This leads to the introduction of a novel taxonomy for Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs. In addition, a comprehensive overview of the research on Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs is presented and put into the context of the taxonomy. Finally, research gaps in the field of Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs are identified for future research.",

        "abstract": "Thanks to rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in recent years, the current artificial intelligence technology is contributing to many part of society. Education, environment, medical care, military, tourism, economy, politics, etc. are having a very large impact on society as a whole. For example, in the field of education, there is an artificial intelligence tutoring system that automatically assigns tutors based on student's level. In the field of economics, there are quantitative investment methods that automatically analyze large amounts of data to find investment laws to create investment models or predict changes in financial markets. As such, artificial intelligence technology is being used in various fields. So, it is very important to know exactly what factors have an important influence on each field of artificial intelligence technology and how the relationship between each field is connected. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze artificial intelligence technology in each field. In this paper, we analyze patent documents related to artificial intelligence technology. We propose a method for keyword analysis within factors using artificial intelligence patent data sets for artificial intelligence technology analysis. This is a model that relies on feature engineering based on deep learning model named KeyBERT, and using vector space model. A case study of collecting and analyzing artificial intelligence patent data was conducted to show how the proposed model can be applied to real world problems.",

The current issue with artificial intelligence is a lack of transparency into its decision making, and literature shows that increasing transparency increases trust. Explainable artificial intelligence has the ability to increase transparency of AI, which could potentially increase trust for humans. This paper attempts to use the task of predicting yelp review star ratings with assistance from an explainable and non explainable artificial intelligence to see if trust is increased with increased transparency. Results show that for these tasks, explainable artificial intelligence provided significant increase in trust as a measure of influence.",

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence is widely regarded as a transformative force with the potential to redefine numerous sectors of human civilization. While Artificial Intelligence has evolved from speculative fiction to a pivotal element of technological progress, its role as a truly transformative agent, or transformative Artificial Intelligence, remains a subject of debate. This work explores the historical precedents of technological breakthroughs, examining whether Artificial Intelligence can achieve a comparable impact, and it delves into various ethical frameworks that shape the perception and development of Artificial Intelligence. Additionally, it considers the societal, technical, and regulatory challenges that must be addressed for Artificial Intelligence to become a catalyst for global change. We also examine not only the strategies and methodologies that could lead to transformative Artificial Intelligence but also the barriers that could ultimately make these goals unattainable. We end with a critical inquiry into whether reaching a transformative Artificial Intelligence might compel humanity to adopt an entirely new ethical approach, tailored to the complexities of advanced Artificial Intelligence. By addressing the ethical, social, and scientific dimensions of Artificial Intelligence's development, this work contributes to the broader discourse on the long-term implications of Artificial Intelligence and its capacity to drive civilization toward a new era of progress or, conversely, exacerbate existing inequalities and risks.",

Learning and optimisation, decision making in dynamic and uncertain environments, game theory, planning and scheduling, design and education are common research areas shared between games and real-world problems. Numerous open-source games or game-based environments have been implemented for studying artificial intelligence. In addition to single- or multi-player, collaborative or adversarial games, there has also been growing interest in implementing platforms for creative design in recent years. Those platforms provide ideal benchmarks for exploring and comparing artificial intelligence ideas and techniques. This paper reviews the games and game-based platforms for artificial intelligence research, provides guidance on matching particular types of artificial intelligence with suitable games for testing and matching particular needs in games with suitable artificial intelligence techniques, discusses the research trend induced by the evolution of those games and platforms, and gives an outlook.",

        "abstract": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technologies, particularly in recent years, has led to the emergence of several large parameter artificial intelligence weather forecast models. These models represent a significant breakthrough, overcoming the limitations of traditional numerical weather prediction models and indicating the emergence of profound potential tools for atmosphere-ocean forecasts. This study explores the evolution of these advanced artificial intelligence forecast models, and based on the identified commonalities, proposes the \"Three Large Rules\" to measure their development. We discuss the potential of artificial intelligence in revolutionizing numerical weather prediction, and briefly outlining the underlying reasons for its great potential. While acknowledging the high accuracy, computational efficiency, and ease of deployment of large artificial intelligence forecast models, we also emphasize the irreplaceable values of traditional numerical forecasts and explore the challenges in the future development of large-scale artificial intelligence atmosphere-ocean forecast models. We believe that the optimal future of atmosphere-ocean weather forecast lies in achieving a seamless integration of artificial intelligence and traditional numerical models. Such a synthesis is anticipated to offer a more advanced and reliable approach for improved atmosphere-ocean forecasts. Additionally, we illustrate how forecasters can adapt and leverage the advanced artificial intelligence model through an example by building a large artificial intelligence model for global ocean wave forecast.",

In this paper, we build a model of finite-time technological singularity assuming that artificial intelligence will replace humans for artificial intelligence engineers after some point in time when it is developed enough. This model implies the following: let A be the level of development of artificial intelligence. Then, the moment of technological singularity n is defined as the point in time where artificial intelligence development function approaches infinity. Thus, it happens in finite time. Although infinite level of development of artificial intelligence cannot be reached practically, this approximation is useful for several reasons, firstly because it allows modeling a phase transition or a change of regime. In the model, intelligence growth function appears to be hyperbolic function under relatively broad conditions which we list and compare. Subsequently, we also add a stochastic term (Brownian motion) to the model and investigate the changes in its behavior. The results can be applied for the modeling of dynamics of various processes characterized by multiplicative growth.",

An important characteristic of several methodologies that reason with changes in belief or belief updates, is a property that we term modularity. We call updates that satisfy this property modular updates. Whereas probabilistic measures of belief update - which satisfy the modularity property were first discovered in the nineteenth century, knowledge and discussion of these quantities remains obscure in artificial intelligence research. We define modular updates and discuss their inappropriate use in two influential expert systems.",

However, this bright future has a dark side: a dramatic job market contraction before its unpredictable transformation. Hence, in a near future, large numbers of job seekers will need financial support while catching up with these novel unpredictable jobs. This possible job market crisis has an antidote inside. In fact, the rise of AI is sustained by the biggest knowledge theft of the recent years. Learning AI machines are extracting knowledge from unaware skilled or unskilled workers by analyzing their interactions. By passionately doing their jobs, these workers are digging their own graves.   In this paper, we propose Human-in-the-loop Artificial Intelligence (HIT-AI) as a fairer paradigm for Artificial Intelligence systems. HIT-AI will reward aware and unaware knowledge producers with a different scheme: decisions of AI systems generating revenues will repay the legitimate owners of the knowledge used for taking those decisions. As modern Robin Hoods, HIT-AI researchers should fight for a fairer Artificial Intelligence that gives back what it steals.",

This article analyzes and evaluates the challenges that the AI development level is facing, and proposes that the evaluation methods for the human intelligence test and the AI system are not uniform; and the key reason for which is that none of the models can uniformly describe the AI system and the beings like human. Aiming at this problem, a standard intelligent system model is established in this study to describe the AI system and the beings like human uniformly. Based on the model, the article makes an abstract mathematical description, and builds the standard intelligent machine mathematical model; expands the Von Neumann architecture and proposes the Liufeng - Shiyong architecture; gives the definition of the artificial intelligence IQ, and establishes the artificial intelligence scale and the evaluation method; conduct the test on 50 search engines and three human subjects at different ages across the world, and finally obtains the ranking of the absolute IQ and deviation IQ ranking for artificial intelligence IQ 2014.",

        "abstract": "There has been a recent resurgence in the area of explainable artificial intelligence as researchers and practitioners seek to make their algorithms more understandable. Much of this research is focused on explicitly explaining decisions or actions to a human observer, and it should not be controversial to say that looking at how humans explain to each other can serve as a useful starting point for explanation in artificial intelligence. However, it is fair to say that most work in explainable artificial intelligence uses only the researchers' intuition of what constitutes a `good' explanation. There exists vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science of how people define, generate, select, evaluate, and present explanations, which argues that people employ certain cognitive biases and social expectations towards the explanation process. This paper argues that the field of explainable artificial intelligence should build on this existing research, and reviews relevant papers from philosophy, cognitive psychology/science, and social psychology, which study these topics. It draws out some important findings, and discusses ways that these can be infused with work on explainable artificial intelligence.",

However, for the effective defense against dynamically evolving attacks on networks, it is difficult to develop software with conventional fixed algorithms. This can be achieved by using artificial intelligence methods that provide flexibility and learning capability. The likelihood of developing cyber defense capabilities through increased intelligence of defense systems is quite high. Given the problems associated with cyber defense in real life, it is clear that many cyber defense problems can be successfully solved only when artificial intelligence methods are used. In this article, the current artificial intelligence practices and techniques are reviewed and the use and importance of artificial intelligence in cyber defense systems is mentioned. The aim of this article is to be able to explain the use of these methods in the field of cyber defense with current examples by considering and analyzing the artificial intelligence technologies and methodologies that are currently being developed and integrating them with the role and adaptation of the technology and methodology in the defense of cyberspace.",

One very important industry trend is the move to convert existing human dwellings to smart buildings, and to create new smart buildings. Smart buildings aim to mitigate climate change by reducing energy consumption and associated carbon emissions. To accomplish this, they leverage artificial intelligence, big data, and machine learning algorithms to learn and optimize system performance. These fields of research are currently very rapidly evolving and advancing, but there has been very little guidance to help engineers and architects working on smart buildings apply artificial intelligence algorithms and technologies in a systematic and effective manner. In this paper we present B-SMART: the first reference architecture for autonomic smart buildings. B-SMART facilitates the application of artificial intelligence techniques and technologies to smart buildings by decoupling conceptually distinct layers of functionality and organizing them into an autonomic control loop. We also present a case study illustrating how B-SMART can be applied to accelerate the introduction of artificial intelligence into an existing smart building.",

However, contemporary artificial intelligence systems are built by composing many preexisting software modules that pass through many hands before becoming a finished product or service. How does this shape responsible artificial intelligence practice? In interviews with 27 artificial intelligence engineers across industry, open source, and academia, our participants often did not see the questions posed in responsible artificial intelligence guidelines to be within their agency, capability, or responsibility to address. We use Suchman's \"located accountability\" to show how responsible artificial intelligence labor is currently organized and to explore how it could be done differently. We identify cross-cutting social logics, like modularizability, scale, reputation, and customer orientation, that organize which responsible artificial intelligence actions do take place and which are relegated to low status staff or believed to be the work of the next or previous person in the imagined \"supply chain.\" We argue that current responsible artificial intelligence interventions, like ethics checklists and guidelines that assume panoptical knowledge and control over systems, could be improved by taking a located accountability approach, recognizing where relations and obligations might intertwine inside and outside of this supply chain.",

Smartphones, social media platforms, search engines, and autonomous vehicles are just a few examples of applications that utilize artificial intelligence technologies to enhance their performance. This study carries out a scoping review of the current state-of-the-art artificial intelligence technologies following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework. The goal was to find the most advanced technologies used in different domains of artificial intelligence technology research. Three recognized journals were used from artificial intelligence and machine learning domain: Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Journal of Machine Learning Research, and Machine Learning, and articles published in 2022 were observed. Certain qualifications were laid for the technological solutions: the technology must be tested against comparable solutions, commonly approved or otherwise well justified datasets must be used while applying, and results must show improvements against comparable solutions. One of the most important parts of the technology development appeared to be how to process and exploit the data gathered from multiple sources. The data can be highly unstructured, and the technological solution should be able to utilize the data with minimum manual work from humans. The results of this review indicate that creating labeled datasets is very laborious, and solutions exploiting unsupervised or semi-supervised learning technologies are more and more researched. The learning algorithms should be able to be updated efficiently, and predictions should be interpretable. Using artificial intelligence technologies in real-world applications, safety and explainable predictions are mandatory to consider before mass adoption can occur.",

In order to achieve this goal they ought to use all the information available and consider all the choices available to choose an optimal choice. This paper investigates what happens when decisions are made by artificially intelligent machines in the market rather than human beings. Firstly, the expectations of the future are more consistent if they are made by an artificially intelligent machine and the decisions are more rational and thus marketplace becomes more rational.",

To create a more efficient and effective healthcare system, three technical challenges immediately present themselves: healthcare access, healthcare equity, and healthcare efficiency. An autonomous mobile clinic solves the healthcare access problem by bringing healthcare services to the patient by the order of the patient's fingertips. Nevertheless, to enable a universal autonomous mobile clinic network, a three-stage technical roadmap needs to be achieved: In stage one, we focus on solving the inequity challenge in the existing healthcare system by combining autonomous mobility and telemedicine. In stage two, we develop an AI doctor for primary care, which we foster from infancy to adulthood with clean healthcare data. With the AI doctor, we can solve the inefficiency problem. In stage three, after we have proven that the autonomous mobile clinic network can truly solve the target clinical use cases, we shall open up the platform for all medical verticals, thus enabling universal healthcare through this whole new system.",

These services are realized through control and monitoring applications that are typically developed using artificial intelligence/machine learning-based algorithms, which play a significant role in highlighting the efficiency of traditional healthcare systems. Current personalized healthcare services are dedicated to a specific environment to support technological personalization. However, they are unable to consider different interrelated health conditions, leading to inappropriate diagnoses and affecting sustainability and the long-term health of patients. To this end, current Healthcare 5.0 technology has evolved that supersede previous healthcare technologies. The goal of healthcare 5.0 is to achieve an autonomous healthcare service, that takes into account the interdependent effect of different health conditions of a patient. This paper conducts a comprehensive survey on personalized healthcare services. In particular, we first present an overview of key requirements of comprehensive personalized healthcare services in modern healthcare Internet of Things (HIoT), including the definition of personalization and an example use case scenario as a representative for modern HIoT. Second, we explored a fundamental three-layer architecture for IoT-based healthcare systems using AI and non-AI-based approaches, considering key requirements for CPHS followed by their strengths and weaknesses in the frame of personalized healthcare services. Third, we highlighted different security threats against each layer of IoT architecture along with the possible AI and non-AI-based solutions. Finally, we propose a methodology to develop reliable, resilient, and personalized healthcare services that address the identified weaknesses of existing approaches.",

Although the healthcare blockchain technology has attracted broad interests and attention in industry, government and academia, the security and privacy concerns remain the focus of debate when deploying blockchains for information sharing in the healthcare sector from business operation to research collaboration. This paper focuses on the security and privacy requirements for medical data sharing using blockchain, and provides a comprehensive analysis of the security and privacy risks and requirements, accompanied by technical solution techniques and strategies. First, we discuss the security and privacy requirements and attributes required for electronic medical data sharing by deploying the healthcare blockchain. Second, we categorize existing efforts into three reference blockchain usage scenarios for electronic medical data sharing, and discuss the technologies for implementing these security and privacy properties in the three categories of usage scenarios for healthcare blockchain, such as anonymous signatures, attribute-based encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, verification techniques for smart contract security. Finally, we discuss other potential blockchain application scenarios in healthcare sector. We conjecture that this survey will help healthcare professionals, decision makers, and healthcare service developers to gain technical and intuitive insights into the security and privacy of healthcare blockchains in terms of concepts, risks, requirements, development and deployment technologies and systems.",

This hinders a comprehensive understanding of the risks that healthcare AI entails. To address this gap, this paper takes a thorough examination of existing healthcare AI S&P research, providing a unified framework that allows the identification of under-explored areas. Our survey presents a systematic overview of healthcare AI attacks and defenses, and points out challenges and research opportunities for each AI-driven healthcare application domain.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the strategic imperative for healthcare organizations to develop proprietary foundation models rather than relying exclusively on commercial alternatives. We examine four fundamental considerations driving this imperative: the domain-specific requirements of healthcare data representation, critical data sovereignty and governance considerations unique to healthcare, strategic competitive advantages afforded by proprietary AI infrastructure, and the transformative potential of healthcare-specific foundation models for patient care and organizational operations. Through analysis of empirical evidence, economic frameworks, and organizational case studies, we demonstrate that proprietary multimodal foundation models enable healthcare organizations to achieve superior clinical performance, maintain robust data governance, create sustainable competitive advantages, and accelerate innovation pathways. While acknowledging implementation challenges, we present evidence showing organizations with proprietary AI capabilities demonstrate measurably improved outcomes, faster innovation cycles, and stronger strategic positioning in the evolving healthcare ecosystem. This analysis provides healthcare leaders with a comprehensive framework for evaluating build-versus-buy decisions regarding foundation model implementation, positioning proprietary foundation model development as a cornerstone capability for forward-thinking healthcare organizations.",

        "abstract": "The recent advancements in computing systems and wireless communications have made healthcare systems more efficient than before. Modern healthcare devices can monitor and manage different health conditions of the patients automatically without any manual intervention from medical professionals. Additionally, the use of implantable medical devices (IMDs), body area networks (BANs), and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in healthcare systems improve the overall patient monitoring and treatment process. However, these systems are complex in software and hardware, and optimizing between security, privacy, and treatment is crucial for healthcare systems as any security or privacy violation can lead to severe effects on patients' treatments and overall health conditions. Indeed, the healthcare domain is increasingly facing security challenges and threats due to numerous design flaws and the lack of proper security measures in healthcare devices and applications. In this paper, we explore various security and privacy threats to healthcare systems and discuss the consequences of these threats. We present a detailed survey of different potential attacks and discuss their impacts. Furthermore, we review the existing security measures proposed for healthcare systems and discuss their limitations. Finally, we conclude the paper with future research directions toward securing healthcare systems against common vulnerabilities.",

        "abstract": "Since the number of elderly and patients who are in hospitals and healthcare centers are growing, providing efficient remote healthcare services seems very important. Currently, most such systems benefit from the distribution and autonomy features of multiagent systems and the structure of wireless sensor networks. On the one hand, securing the data of remote healthcare systems is one of the most significant concerns; particularly recent types of research about the security of remote healthcare systems keep them secure from eavesdropping and data modification. On the other hand, existing remote healthcare systems are still vulnerable against other common attacks of healthcare networks such as Denial of Service (DoS) and User to Root (U2R) attacks, because they are managed remotely and based on the Internet. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a secure framework for remote healthcare systems that consists of two phases. First, we design a healthcare system base on multiagent technology to collect data from a sensor network. Then, in the second phase, a layered architecture of intrusion detection systems that uses Support Vector Machine to learn the behavior of network traffic is applied. Based on our framework, we implement a secure remote healthcare system and evaluate this system against the frequent attacks of healthcare networks such as Smurf, Buffer overflow, Neptune, and Pod attacks. In the end, evaluation parameters of the layered architecture of intrusion detection systems prove the efficiency and correctness of our proposed framework.",

        "abstract": "Although healthcare is a remarkably sensitive domain of application, and systems that exert direct control over the world can cause harm in a way that humans cannot necessarily correct or oversee, it is still unclear whether and how healthcare robots are currently regulated or should be regulated. Existing regulations are primarily unprepared to provide guidance for such a rapidly evolving field and accommodate devices that rely on machine learning and AI. Moreover, the field of healthcare robotics is very rich and extensive, but it is still very much scattered and unclear in terms of definitions, medical and technical classifications, product characteristics, purpose, and intended use. As a result, these devices often navigate between the medical device regulation or other non-medical norms, such as the ISO personal care standard. Before regulating the field of healthcare robots, it is therefore essential to map the major state-of-the-art developments in healthcare robotics, their capabilities and applications, and the challenges we face as a result of their integration within the healthcare environment.   This contribution fills in this gap and lack of clarity currently experienced within healthcare robotics and its governance by providing a structured overview of and further elaboration on the main categories now established, their intended purpose, use, and main characteristics. We explicitly focus on surgical, assistive, and service robots to rightfully match the definition of healthcare as the organized provision of medical care to individuals, including efforts to maintain, treat, or restore physical, mental, or emotional well-being. We complement these findings with policy recommendations to help policymakers unravel an optimal regulatory framing for healthcare robot technologies",

Traditionally, AI techniques require centralized data collection and processing that may be infeasible in realistic healthcare scenarios due to the high scalability of modern healthcare networks and growing data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL), as an emerging distributed collaborative AI paradigm, is particularly attractive for smart healthcare, by coordinating multiple clients (e.g., hospitals) to perform AI training without sharing raw data. Accordingly, we provide a comprehensive survey on the use of FL in smart healthcare. First, we present the recent advances in FL, the motivations, and the requirements of using FL in smart healthcare. The recent FL designs for smart healthcare are then discussed, ranging from resource-aware FL, secure and privacy-aware FL to incentive FL and personalized FL. Subsequently, we provide a state-of-the-art review on the emerging applications of FL in key healthcare domains, including health data management, remote health monitoring, medical imaging, and COVID-19 detection. Several recent FL-based smart healthcare projects are analyzed, and the key lessons learned from the survey are also highlighted. Finally, we discuss interesting research challenges and possible directions for future FL research in smart healthcare.",

Furthermore, very few studies examine the key challenges from the perspective of stakeholders of the smart healthcare system. The objective of this research study is to identify the key challenges associated with each stakeholder of the smart healthcare system. We have identified 27 challenges associated with eight key stakeholders of smart healthcare reported in the state-of-the-art literature. Further, a quantitative survey was conducted and the data from 85 respondents were collected in order to assess the significance of challenges in the real-world smart healthcare system. The collected data from the respondents were further analyzed using the smart-PSL (3.0). The results indicated that all the identified challenges associated with each stakeholder negatively influence the smart healthcare system.",

This shift is followed by healthcare industries creating the term Healthcare 4.0. In Healthcare 4.0, the use of IoT-enabled medical imaging devices for early disease detection has enabled medical practitioners to increase healthcare institutions' quality of service. However, Healthcare 4.0 is still lagging in Artificial Intelligence and big data compared to other Industry 4.0 due to data privacy concerns. In addition, institutions' diverse storage and computing capabilities restrict institutions from incorporating the same training model structure. This paper presents a secure multi-party computation-based ensemble federated learning with blockchain that enables heterogeneous models to collaboratively learn from healthcare institutions' data without violating users' privacy. Blockchain properties also allow the party to enjoy data integrity without trust in a centralized server while also providing each healthcare institution with auditability and version control capability.",

Left unchecked, these risks can compromise patient safety and erode trust in healthcare AI systems. While general-purpose frameworks like Llama Guard are useful for filtering toxicity and harmful content, they do not fully address the stringent requirements for truthfulness and safety in healthcare contexts.

        "abstract": "A statistical description and model of individual healthcare expenditures in the US has been developed for measuring value in healthcare. We find evidence that healthcare expenditures are quantifiable as an infusion-diffusion process, which can be thought of intuitively as a steady change in the intensity of treatment superimposed on a random process reflecting variations in the efficiency and effectiveness of treatment. The arithmetic mean represents the net average annual cost of healthcare; and when multiplied by the arithmetic standard deviation, which represents the effective risk, the result is a measure of healthcare cost control. Policymakers, providers, payors, or patients that decrease these parameters are generating value in healthcare. The model has an average absolute prediction error of approximately 10-12% across the range of expenditures which spans 6 orders of magnitude over a nearly 10-year period. For the top 1% of the population with the largest expenditures, representing 20%-30% of total spending on healthcare, a power-law relationship emerges. This relationship also applies to the most expensive medical conditions in the US. A fundamental connection between healthcare expenditures and mathematical finance is found by showing that the process healthcare expenditures follow is similar to a widely used model for managing financial assets, leading to the conclusion that a combination of these two fields may yield useful results.",

The main advantage of healthcare cloud is that it can be used as a tool for patients, medical professionals and insurance providers, to query and coordinate among medical departments, organizations and other healthcare related hubs. Although healthcare cloud services can enable better medication process with high responsiveness, but the privacy and other requirements of the patients need to be ensured in the process. Patients medical data may be required by the medical professionals, hospitals, diagnostic centers for analysis and diagnosis. However, data privacy and service quality cannot be compromised. In other words, there may exist various service providers corresponding to a specific healthcare service. The main challenge is to find the appropriate providers that comply best with patients requirement. In this paper, we propose a query based optimal medication framework to support the patients healthcare service accessibility comprehensively with considerable response time. The framework accepts related healthcare queries in natural language through a comprehensive user-interface and then processes the input query through a first order logic based evaluation engine and finds all possible services satisfying the requirements. First order logic is used for modeling of user requirements and queries. The query evaluation engine is built using zChaff, a Boolean logic satisfiability solver. The efficacy and usability of the framework is evaluated with initial case studies on synthetic and real life healthcare cloud.",

The integration of innovative technologies like Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Big Data, Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, and Blockchain with Healthcare services has led to improved performance and efficiency through data-based learning and interconnection of systems. On the other hand, it has also increased complexities and has brought its own share of vulnerabilities due to the heavy influx, sharing, and storage of healthcare data. The protection of the same from cyber-attacks along with privacy preservation through authenticated access is one of the significant challenges for the healthcare sector. For this purpose, the use of blockchain-based networks can lead to a considerable reduction in the vulnerabilities of the healthcare systems and secure their data. This chapter explores blockchain's role in strengthening healthcare data security by answering the questions related to what data use, when we need, why we need, who needs, and how state-of-the-art techniques use blockchains to secure healthcare data. As a case study, we also explore and analyze the state-of-the-art implementations for blockchain in healthcare data security for the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to provide a path to future research directions, we identify and discuss the technical limitations and regulatory challenges associated with blockchain-based healthcare data security implementation.",

It begins with thoroughly examining previous natural language processing (NLP) approaches in healthcare, shedding light on the limitations and challenges these methods face. Following that, this research explores the path that led to the incorporation of BioBERT into healthcare applications, highlighting its suitability for addressing the specific requirements of tasks related to biomedical text mining. The analysis outlines a systematic methodology for fine-tuning BioBERT to meet the unique needs of the healthcare domain. This approach includes various components, including the gathering of data from a wide range of healthcare sources, data annotation for tasks like identifying medical entities and categorizing them, and the application of specialized preprocessing techniques tailored to handle the complexities found in biomedical texts. Additionally, the paper covers aspects related to model evaluation, with a focus on healthcare benchmarks and functions like processing of natural language in biomedical, question-answering, clinical document classification, and medical entity recognition. It explores techniques to improve the model's interpretability and validates its performance compared to existing healthcare-focused language models. The paper thoroughly examines ethical considerations, particularly patient privacy and data security. It highlights the benefits of incorporating BioBERT into healthcare contexts, including enhanced clinical decision support and more efficient information retrieval. Nevertheless, it acknowledges the impediments and complexities of this integration, encompassing concerns regarding data privacy, transparency, resource-intensive requirements, and the necessity for model customization to align with diverse healthcare domains.",

Despite the impending widespread deployment of HFMs, there is currently a lack of clear understanding about how they work in the healthcare field, their current challenges, and where they are headed in the future. To answer these questions, a comprehensive and deep survey of the challenges, opportunities, and future directions of HFMs is presented in this survey. It first conducted a comprehensive overview of the HFM including the methods, data, and applications for a quick grasp of the current progress. Then, it made an in-depth exploration of the challenges present in data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures for constructing and widespread application of foundation models in healthcare. This survey also identifies emerging and promising directions in this field for future development. We believe that this survey will enhance the community's comprehension of the current progress of HFM and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future development in this field.

        "abstract": "Since the inception of the Bitcoin technology, its underlying data structure--the blockchain--has garnered much attention due to properties such as decentralization, transparency, and immutability. These properties make blockchains suitable for apps that require disintermediation through trustless exchange, consistent and incorruptible transaction records, and operational models beyond cryptocurrency. In particular, blockchain and its smart contract capabilities have the potential to address healthcare interoperability issues, such as enabling effective interactions between users and medical applications, delivering patient data securely to a variety of organizations and devices, and improving the overall efficiency of medical practice workflow. Despite the interest in using blockchain for healthcare interoperability, however, little information is available on the concrete architectural styles and patterns for applying blockchain to healthcare apps. This paper provides an initial step in filling this gap by showing: (1) the features and implementation challenges in healthcare interoperability, (2) an end-to-end case study of a blockchain-based healthcare app we are developing, and (3) how applying foundational software patterns can help address common interoperability challenges faced by blockchain-based healthcare apps.",

The dynamics of the model builds upon a recently developed systems architecture for healthcare delivery which bears several analogies to the architecture of mass-customized production systems. At its essence, the model consists of two synchronized Petri nets; one for the healthcare delivery system and another for individuals' health state evolution. The model is demonstrated on two clinical case studies; one acute and another chronic. Together, the case studies show that the model applies equally to the care of both acute and chronic conditions, transparently describes health outcomes and links them to the evolution of the healthcare delivery system and its associated costs.",

However, these efforts have been tainted by several challenges such as fragmentation, lack of standardization and co-ordination. Subsequently, the undertakings of eHealth articulated in health strategy/policy documents have not been fully realised. The implications of this has been that the majority of the population still access inadequate healthcare services. The aim of this paper is to explain why the current integration efforts do not adequately facilitate healthcare work activities in public hospitals in under-served contexts of South Africa. A critical realist perspective within a qualitative approach was adopted. A total of 21 participants were purposively sampled and interviewed because of their knowledge and experience in the healthcare service delivery process as well as their involvement in the integration of ehealth. The study applied the Activity Analysis and Development (ActAD) model as a theoretical analytical tool and draws on normalization process theory (NPT) as an explanatory framework. The findings highlight generative mechanisms such as the inadequate analysis of system's fit-for-purpose in healthcare workflows have inhibiting effects in the integration process of eHealth.",

In this regard, edge computing technology can reduce latency and energy consumption by moving processes closer to the data sources in comparison to the traditional centralized cloud and IoT-based healthcare systems. In addition, by bringing automated insights into the smart healthcare systems, artificial intelligence (AI) provides the possibility of detecting and predicting high-risk diseases in advance, decreasing medical costs for patients, and offering efficient treatments. The objective of this article is to highlight the benefits of the adoption of edge intelligent technology, along with AI in smart healthcare systems. Moreover, a novel smart healthcare model is proposed to boost the utilization of AI and edge technology in smart healthcare systems.

        "abstract": "A meaningful understanding of clinical protocols and patient pathways helps improve healthcare outcomes. Electronic health records (EHR) reflect real-world treatment behaviours that are used to enhance healthcare management but present challenges; protocols and pathways are often loosely defined and with elements frequently not recorded in EHRs, complicating the enhancement. To solve this challenge, healthcare objectives associated with healthcare management activities can be indirectly observed in EHRs as latent topics. Topic models, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), are used to identify latent patterns in EHR data. However, they do not examine the ordered nature of EHR sequences, nor do they appraise individual events in isolation. Our novel approach, the Categorical Sequence Encoder (CaSE) addresses these shortcomings. The sequential nature of EHRs is captured by CaSE's event-level representations, revealing latent healthcare objectives. In synthetic EHR sequences, CaSE outperforms LDA by up to 37% at identifying healthcare objectives. In the real-world MIMIC-III dataset, CaSE identifies meaningful representations that could critically enhance protocol and pathway development.",

        "abstract": "The concept of blockchain has emerged as an effective solution for data-sensitive domains, such as healthcare, financial services, etc., due to its various attributes like immutability, non-repudiation, and availability. Thus, implementation of this technology in various domains rose exponentially; one of such fields is the healthcare supply chain. Managing healthcare supply chain processes effectively is very crucial for the healthcare system. Despite various innovations in the method of treatment methodologies, the healthcare supply chain management system is not up to the mark and lacks efficiency. The traditional healthcare supply chain system is time-consuming and lacks the work synergy among the various stakeholders of the supply chain. Thus, In this paper, we propose a framework based on blockchain smart contracts and decentralized storage to connect all the supply chain stakeholders. Smart contracts in the framework enforce and depict various interactions and transactions among the stakeholders, thus helping to automate these processes, promote transparency, improve efficiency, and minimize service time. The preliminary results show that the proposed framework is more efficient, secure, and economically feasible.",

This study explores the effects of different functional, personal, and risk factors on trust in and adoption of healthcare voice AI assistants (HVAs), generating a partial least squares structural model from a survey of 300 voice assistant users. Our results indicate that trust in HVAs can be significantly explained by functional factors (usefulness, content credibility, quality of service relative to a healthcare professional), together with security, and privacy risks and personal stance in technology. We also discuss differences in terms of trust between HVAs and general-purpose voice assistants as well as implications that are unique to HVAs.",

Digital healthcare solutions employ numerous low-power and resource-constrained connected things, such as the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). However, the current digital healthcare solutions will face two major challenges. First, the proposed solutions are based on the traditional IoT-Cloud model that will experience latency and reliability challenges to meet the expectations and requirements of digital healthcare, while potentially inflicting heavy network load. Second, the existing digital healthcare solutions will face security challenges due to the inherent limitations of IoMT caused by the lack of resources for proper security in those devices. Therefore, in this research, we present a decentralized adaptive security architecture for the successful deployment of digital healthcare. The proposed architecture leverages the edge-cloud continuum to meet the performance, efficiency, and reliability requirements. It can adapt the security solution at run-time to meet the limited capacity of IoMT devices without compromising the security of critical data.

        "abstract": "Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle on out-of-domain datasets like healthcare focused text. We explore specialized pre-training to adapt smaller LLMs to different healthcare datasets. Three methods are assessed: traditional masked language modeling, Deep Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Textual Representations (DeCLUTR), and a novel pre-training objective utilizing metadata categories from the healthcare settings. These schemes are evaluated on downstream document classification tasks for each dataset, with additional analysis of the resultant embedding spaces. Contrastively trained models outperform other approaches on the classification tasks, delivering strong performance from limited labeled data and with fewer model parameter updates required. While metadata-based pre-training does not further improve classifications across the datasets, it yields interesting embedding cluster separability. All domain adapted LLMs outperform their publicly available general base LLM, validating the importance of domain-specialization. This research illustrates efficient approaches to instill healthcare competency in compact LLMs even under tight computational budgets, an essential capability for responsible and sustainable deployment in local healthcare settings. We provide pre-training guidelines for specialized healthcare LLMs, motivate continued inquiry into contrastive objectives, and demonstrates adaptation techniques to align small LLMs with privacy-sensitive medical tasks.",

Resilience is defined as the system's ability to absorb, recover from, and adapt to disruptions; however, despite extensive studies on this subject, we still lack empirical evidence and mathematical tools to quantify its adaptability (the ability of the system to adjust to and learn from disruptions). By analyzing millions of patients' electronic medical records across US states, we find that the COVID-19 pandemic caused two successive waves of disruptions within the healthcare systems, enabling natural experiment analysis of the adaptive capacity for each system to adapt to past disruptions. We generalize the quantification framework and find that the US healthcare systems exhibit substantial adaptability but only a moderate level of resilience. When considering system responses across racial groups, Black and Hispanic groups were more severely impacted by pandemic disruptions than White and Asian groups. Physician abundance is the key characteristic for determining healthcare system resilience. Our results offer vital guidance in designing resilient and sustainable healthcare systems to prepare for future waves of disruptions akin to COVID-19 pandemics.",

When an anomaly of a patient is detected, it will be alerted to healthcare professionals for proper intervention. Remote healthcare offers substantial benefits for both patients and healthcare providers as patients may avoid expensive in-patient care by choosing the comfort of staying at home while being monitored after a surgery and healthcare providers can resolve challenges between limited resources and a growing population.   While remote healthcare through wearable devices is ubiquitous and affordable, it raises concerns about patient privacy. Patients may wonder: Is my data stored in the cloud safe? Can anyone access and manipulate my data for blackmailing? Hence, securing patient private information end-to-end becomes crucial.

Oslo City's primary goal is to utilize automated solutions for continuous testing of these REST APIs at each evolution stage, thereby ensuring their dependability. Although the literature offers various automated REST API testing tools, their effectiveness in regression testing of the evolving REST APIs of healthcare IoT applications within a DevOps context remains undetermined. This paper evaluates state-of-the-art and well-established REST API testing tools-specifically, RESTest, EvoMaster, Schemathesis, RESTler, and RestTestGen-for the regression testing of a real-world healthcare IoT application, considering failures, faults, coverage, regressions, and cost. We conducted experiments using all accessible REST APIs (17 APIs with 120 endpoints), and 14 releases evolved during DevOps.

        "abstract": "Healthcare question answering assistance aims to provide customer healthcare information, which widely appears in both Web and mobile Internet. The questions usually require the assistance to have proficient healthcare background knowledge as well as the reasoning ability on the knowledge. Recently a challenge involving complex healthcare reasoning, HeadQA dataset, has been proposed, which contains multiple-choice questions authorized for the public healthcare specialization exam. Unlike most other QA tasks that focus on linguistic understanding, HeadQA requires deeper reasoning involving not only knowledge extraction, but also complex reasoning with healthcare knowledge. These questions are the most challenging for current QA systems, and the current performance of the state-of-the-art method is slightly better than a random guess. In order to solve this challenging task, we present a Multi-step reasoning with Knowledge extraction framework (MurKe). The proposed framework first extracts the healthcare knowledge as supporting documents from the large corpus. In order to find the reasoning chain and choose the correct answer, MurKe iterates between selecting the supporting documents, reformulating the query representation using the supporting documents and getting entailment score for each choice using the entailment model. The reformulation module leverages selected documents for missing evidence, which maintains interpretability. Moreover, we are striving to make full use of off-the-shelf pre-trained models. With less trainable weight, the pre-trained model can easily adapt to healthcare tasks with limited training samples. From the experimental results and ablation study, our system is able to outperform several strong baselines on the HeadQA dataset.",

Although blockchain has commonly been used as the operational model behind cryptocurrency, it has far more foreseeable utilities in domains like healthcare, where efficient data flow is highly demanded. Particularly, blockchain and related technologies have been touted as foundational technologies for addressing healthcare interoperability challenges, such as promoting effective communications and securing data exchanges across various healthcare systems. Despite the increasing interests in leveraging blockchain technology to improve healthcare infrastructures, a major gap in literature is the lack of available recommendations for concrete architectural styles and design considerations for creating blockchain-based apps and systems with a healthcare focus. This research provides two contributions to bridge the gap in existing research. First, we introduce a pattern sequence for designing blockchain-based healthcare systems focused on secure and at-scale data exchange. Our approach adapts traditional software patterns and proposes novel patterns that take into account both the technical requirements specific to healthcare systems and the implications of these requirements on naive blockchain-based solutions. Second, we provide a pattern-oriented reference architecture using an example application of the pattern sequence for guiding software developers to design interoperable (on the technical level) healthcare IT systems atop blockchain-based infrastructures. The reference architecture focuses on minimizing storage requirements on-chain, preserving the privacy of sensitive information, facilitating scalable communications, and maximizing evolvability of the system.",

        "abstract": "Digital healthcare is essential to facilitate consumers to access and disseminate their medical data easily for enhanced medical care services. However, the significant concern with digitalization across healthcare systems necessitates for a prompt, productive, and secure storage facility along with a vigorous communication strategy, to stimulate sensitive digital healthcare data sharing and proactive estimation of malicious entities. In this context, this paper introduces a comprehensive quantum-based framework to overwhelm the potential security and privacy issues for secure healthcare data management. It equips quantum encryption for the secured storage and dispersal of healthcare data over the shared cloud platform by employing quantum encryption. Also, the framework furnishes a quantum feed-forward neural network unit to examine the intention behind the data request before granting access, for proactive estimation of potential data breach. In this way, the proposed framework delivers overall healthcare data management by coupling the advanced and more competent quantum approach with machine learning to safeguard the data storage, access, and prediction of malicious entities in an automated manner. Thus, the proposed IQ-HDM leads to more cooperative and effective healthcare delivery and empowers individuals with adequate custody of their health data. The experimental evaluation and comparison of the proposed IQ-HDM framework with state-of-the-art methods outline a considerable improvement up to 67.6%, in tackling cyber threats related to healthcare data security.",

        "title": "Securing AI-based Healthcare Systems using Blockchain Technology: A   State-of-the-Art Systematic Literature Review and Future Research Directions",
        "abstract": "Healthcare systems are increasingly incorporating Artificial Intelligence into their systems, but it is not a solution for all difficulties. AI's extraordinary potential is being held back by challenges such as a lack of medical datasets for training AI models, adversarial attacks, and a lack of trust due to its black box working style. We explored how blockchain technology can improve the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-based healthcare. This paper has conducted a Systematic Literature Review to explore the state-of-the-art research studies conducted in healthcare applications developed with different AI techniques and Blockchain Technology. This systematic literature review proceeds with three different paths as natural language processing-based healthcare systems, computer vision-based healthcare systems and acoustic AI-based healthcare systems. We found that 1) Defence techniques for adversarial attacks on AI are available for specific kind of attacks and even adversarial training is AI based technique which in further prone to different attacks. 2) Blockchain can address security and privacy issues in healthcare fraternity. 3) Medical data verification and user provenance can be enabled with Blockchain. 4) Blockchain can protect distributed learning on heterogeneous medical data. 5) The issues like single point of failure, non-transparency in healthcare systems can be resolved with Blockchain. Nevertheless, it has been identified that research is at the initial stage. As a result, we have synthesized a conceptual framework using Blockchain Technology for AI-based healthcare applications that considers the needs of each NLP, Computer Vision, and Acoustic AI application. A global solution for all sort of adversarial attacks on AI based healthcare. However, this technique has significant limits and challenges that need to be addressed in future studies.",

        "abstract": "One of the main issues affecting the Italian NHS is the healthcare deficit: according to current agreements between the Italian State and its Regions, public funding of regional NHS is now limited to the amount of regional deficit and is subject to previous assessment of strict adherence to constraint on regional healthcare balance sheet. Many Regions with previously uncontrolled healthcare deficit have now to plan their \"Piano di Rientro\" (PdR) and submit it for the approval of the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finances. Those Regions that will fail to comply to deficit constraints will suffer cuts on their public NHS financing. A smart Health Planning can make sure health spending is managed appropriately. Indeed a restructuring of the Italian healthcare system has recently been enforced in order to cope for the clumsy regional healthcare balance sheets. Half of total Italian healthcare expenditure is accounted by hospital services which therefore configure as one of the main restructuring targets. This paper provides a general framework for planning a re-engineering of a hospital network. This framework is made of economic, legal and healthcare constraints. We apply the general framework to the particular case of Puglia region and explore a set of re-engineered solutions which to different extent could help solve the difficult dilemma: cutting costs without worsening the delivery of public healthcare services.",

        "abstract": "By introducing networking technologies and services into healthcare infrastructures (e.g., multimodal sensors and smart devices) that are deployed to supervise a person's health condition, the traditional healthcare system is being revolutionized toward knowledge-centric connected healthcare (KCCH), where persons will take their own responsibility for their healthcare in a knowledge-centric way. Due to the volume, velocity, and variety of healthcare supervision data generated by these healthcare infrastructures, an urgent and strategic issue is how to efficiently process a person's healthcare supervision data with the right knowledge of the right guardians (e.g., relatives, nurses, and doctors) at the right time. To solve this issue, the naming and routing criterion of medical knowledge is studied. With this offloaded medical knowledge, we propose an edge learning as a service (EdgeLaaS) framework for KCCH to locally process health supervision data. In this framework, edge learning nodes can help the patient choose better advice from the right guardians in real time when some emergencies occur. Two application cases: 1) fast self-help and 2) mobile help pre-calling are studied. Performance evaluations demonstrate the superiority of KCCH and EdgeLaaS, respectively.",

        "title": "Pathways to Good Healthcare Services and Patient Satisfaction: An   Evolutionary Game Theoretical Approach",
        "abstract": "Spending by the UK's National Health Service (NHS) on independent healthcare treatment has been increased in recent years and is predicted to sustain its upward trend with the forecast of population growth. Some have viewed this increase as an attempt not to expand the patients' choices but to privatize public healthcare. This debate poses a social dilemma whether the NHS should stop cooperating with Private providers. This paper contributes to healthcare economic modelling by investigating the evolution of cooperation among three proposed populations: Public Healthcare Providers, Private Healthcare Providers and Patients. The Patient population is included as a main player in the decision-making process by expanding patient's choices of treatment. We develop a generic basic model that measures the cost of healthcare provision based on given parameters, such as NHS and private healthcare providers' cost of investments in both sectors, cost of treatments and gained benefits. A patient's costly punishment is introduced as a mechanism to enhance cooperation among the three populations. Our findings show that cooperation can be improved with the introduction of punishment (patient's punishment) against defecting providers. Although punishment increases cooperation, it is very costly considering the small improvement in cooperation in comparison to the basic model.",

Due to the sheer size and availability of healthcare data, big data analytics has revolutionized this industry and promises us a world of opportunities. It promises us the power of early detection, prediction, prevention and helps us to improve the quality of life. Researchers and clinicians are working to inhibit big data from having a positive impact on health in the future. Different tools and techniques are being used to analyze, process, accumulate, assimilate and manage large amount of healthcare data either in structured or unstructured form. In this paper, we would like to address the need of big data analytics in healthcare: why and how can it help to improve life?. We present the emerging landscape of big data and analytical techniques in the five sub-disciplines of healthcare i.e.medical image analysis and imaging informatics, bioinformatics, clinical informatics, public health informatics and medical signal analytics. We presents different architectures, advantages and repositories of each discipline that draws an integrated depiction of how distinct healthcare activities are accomplished in the pipeline to facilitate individual patients from multiple perspectives.

In this paper, we present IAC (Informing, Assessment, and Consent), a framework for evaluating patient response to the introduction of AI-enabled digital technologies in healthcare settings. We justify the need for IAC with a general introduction of the challenges with and perceived relevance of AI in human-welfare-centered fields, with an emphasis on the provision of healthcare. The framework is composed of three core principles that guide how healthcare practitioners can inform patients about the use of AI in their healthcare, how practitioners can assess patients' acceptability and comfortability with the use of AI, and how patient consent can be gained after this process. We propose that the principles composing this framework can be translated into guidelines that improve practitioner-patient relationships and, concurrently, patient agency regarding the use of AI in healthcare while broadening the discourse on this topic.",

        "abstract": "The significant increase in the number of individuals with chronic ailments (including the elderly and disabled) has dictated an urgent need for an innovative model for healthcare systems. The evolved model will be more personalized and less reliant on traditional brick-and-mortar healthcare institutions such as hospitals, nursing homes, and long-term healthcare centers. The smart healthcare system is a topic of recently growing interest and has become increasingly required due to major developments in modern technologies, especially in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). This paper is aimed to discuss the current state-of-the-art smart healthcare systems highlighting major areas like wearable and smartphone devices for health monitoring, machine learning for disease diagnosis, and the assistive frameworks, including social robots developed for the ambient assisted living environment. Additionally, the paper demonstrates software integration architectures that are very significant to create smart healthcare systems, integrating seamlessly the benefit of data analytics and other tools of AI. The explained developed systems focus on several facets: the contribution of each developed framework, the detailed working procedure, the performance as outcomes, and the comparative merits and limitations. The current research challenges with potential future directions are addressed to highlight the drawbacks of existing systems and the possible methods to introduce novel frameworks, respectively. This review aims at providing comprehensive insights into the recent developments of smart healthcare systems to equip experts to contribute to the field.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) approaches have demonstrated promising results in a wide range of healthcare applications. Data plays a crucial role in developing ML-based healthcare systems that directly affect people's lives. Many of the ethical issues surrounding the use of ML in healthcare stem from structural inequalities underlying the way we collect, use, and handle data. Developing guidelines to improve documentation practices regarding the creation, use, and maintenance of ML healthcare datasets is therefore of critical importance. In this work, we introduce Healthsheet, a contextualized adaptation of the original datasheet questionnaire ~\\cite{gebru2018datasheets} for health-specific applications. Through a series of semi-structured interviews, we adapt the datasheets for healthcare data documentation. As part of the Healthsheet development process and to understand the obstacles researchers face in creating datasheets, we worked with three publicly-available healthcare datasets as our case studies, each with different types of structured data: Electronic health Records (EHR), clinical trial study data, and smartphone-based performance outcome measures. Our findings from the interviewee study and case studies show 1) that datasheets should be contextualized for healthcare, 2) that despite incentives to adopt accountability practices such as datasheets, there is a lack of consistency in the broader use of these practices 3) how the ML for health community views datasheets and particularly \\textit{Healthsheets} as diagnostic tool to surface the limitations and strength of datasets and 4) the relative importance of different fields in the datasheet to healthcare concerns.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the global Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) industry has evolved at a tremendous speed. Security and privacy are key concerns on the IoMT, owing to the huge scale and deployment of IoMT networks. Machine learning (ML) and blockchain (BC) technologies have significantly enhanced the capabilities and facilities of healthcare 5.0, spawning a new area known as \"Smart Healthcare.\" By identifying concerns early, a smart healthcare system can help avoid long-term damage. This will enhance the quality of life for patients while reducing their stress and healthcare costs. The IoMT enables a range of functionalities in the field of information technology, one of which is smart and interactive health care. However, combining medical data into a single storage location to train a powerful machine learning model raises concerns about privacy, ownership, and compliance with greater concentration. Federated learning (FL) overcomes the preceding difficulties by utilizing a centralized aggregate server to disseminate a global learning model. Simultaneously, the local participant keeps control of patient information, assuring data confidentiality and security. This article conducts a comprehensive analysis of the findings on blockchain technology entangled with federated learning in healthcare. 5.0. The purpose of this study is to construct a secure health monitoring system in healthcare 5.0 by utilizing a blockchain technology and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect any malicious activity in a healthcare network and enables physicians to monitor patients through medical sensors and take necessary measures periodically by predicting diseases.",

The fundamental thing to enhance healthcare services is communicating and linking massive volumes of available healthcare data. However, the key challenge in reaching this ambitious goal is letting the information exchange across heterogeneous sources and methods as well as establishing efficient tools and techniques. Semantic Web (SW) technology can help to tackle these problems. They can enhance knowledge exchange, information management, data interoperability, and decision support in healthcare systems. They can also be utilized to create various e-healthcare systems that aid medical practitioners in making decisions and provide patients with crucial medical information and automated hospital services. This systematic literature review (SLR) on SW in healthcare systems aims to assess and critique previous findings while adhering to appropriate research procedures. We looked at 65 papers and came up with five themes: e-service, disease, information management, frontier technology, and regulatory conditions. In each thematic research area, we presented the contributions of previous literature. We emphasized the topic by responding to five specific research questions. We have finished the SLR study by identifying research gaps and establishing future research goals that will help to minimize the difficulty of adopting SW in healthcare systems and provide new approaches for SW-based medical systems progress.",

        "abstract": "The imbalance between the supply and demand of healthcare resources is a global challenge, which is particularly severe in developing countries. Governments and academic communities have made various efforts to increase healthcare supply and improve resource allocation. However, these efforts often remain passive and inflexible. Alongside these issues, the emergence of the parallel healthcare system has the potential to solve these problems by unlocking the data value. The parallel healthcare system comprises Medicine-Oriented Operating Systems (MOOS), Medicine-Oriented Scenario Engineering (MOSE), and Medicine-Oriented Large Models (MOLMs), which could collect, circulate, and empower data. In this paper, we propose that achieving equilibrium in medical resource allocation is possible through parallel healthcare systems via data empowerment. The supply-demand relationship can be balanced in parallel healthcare systems by (1) increasing the supply provided by digital and robotic doctors in MOOS, (2) identifying individual and potential demands by proactive diagnosis and treatment in MOSE, and (3) improving supply-demand matching using large models in MOLMs. To illustrate the effectiveness of this approach, we present a case study optimizing resource allocation from the perspective of facility accessibility. Results demonstrate that the parallel healthcare system could result in up to 300% improvement in accessibility.",

        "abstract": "A cyber-physical system is considered to be a collection of strongly coupled communication systems and devices that poses numerous security trials in various industrial applications including healthcare. The security and privacy of patient data is still a big concern because healthcare data is sensitive and valuable, and it is most targeted over the internet. Moreover, from the industrial perspective, the cyber-physical system plays a crucial role in the exchange of data remotely using sensor nodes in distributed environments. In the healthcare industry, Blockchain technology offers a promising solution to resolve most securities-related issues due to its decentralized, immutability, and transparency properties. In this paper, a blockchain-inspired secure and reliable data exchange architecture is proposed in the cyber-physical healthcare industry 4.0. The proposed system uses the BigchainDB, Tendermint, Inter-Planetary-File-System (IPFS), MongoDB, and AES encryption algorithms to improve Healthcare 4.0. Furthermore, blockchain-enabled secure healthcare architecture for accessing and managing the records between Doctors and Patients is introduced. The development of a blockchain-based Electronic Healthcare Record (EHR) exchange system is purely patient-centric, which means the entire control of data is in the owner's hand which is backed by blockchain for security and privacy. Our experimental results reveal that the proposed architecture is robust to handle more security attacks and can recover the data if 2/3 of nodes are failed. The proposed model is patient-centric, and control of data is in the patient's hand to enhance security and privacy, even system administrators can't access data without user permission.",

        "abstract": "Given the revolutionary role of metaverses, healthcare metaverses are emerging as a transformative force, creating intelligent healthcare systems that offer immersive and personalized services. The healthcare metaverses allow for effective decision-making and data analytics for users. However, there still exist critical challenges in building healthcare metaverses, such as the risk of sensitive data leakage and issues with sensing data security and freshness, as well as concerns around incentivizing data sharing. In this paper, we first design a user-centric privacy-preserving framework based on decentralized Federated Learning (FL) for healthcare metaverses. To further improve the privacy protection of healthcare metaverses, a cross-chain empowered FL framework is utilized to enhance sensing data security. This framework utilizes a hierarchical cross-chain architecture with a main chain and multiple subchains to perform decentralized, privacy-preserving, and secure data training in both virtual and physical spaces. Moreover, we utilize Age of Information (AoI) as an effective data-freshness metric and propose an AoI-based contract theory model under Prospect Theory (PT) to motivate sensing data sharing in a user-centric manner. This model exploits PT to better capture the subjective utility of the service provider. Finally, our numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes for healthcare metaverses.",

        "title": "From Military to Healthcare: Adopting and Expanding Ethical Principles   for Generative Artificial Intelligence",
        "abstract": "In 2020, the U.S. Department of Defense officially disclosed a set of ethical principles to guide the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies on future battlefields. Despite stark differences, there are core similarities between the military and medical service. Warriors on battlefields often face life-altering circumstances that require quick decision-making. Medical providers experience similar challenges in a rapidly changing healthcare environment, such as in the emergency department or during surgery treating a life-threatening condition. Generative AI, an emerging technology designed to efficiently generate valuable information, holds great promise. As computing power becomes more accessible and the abundance of health data, such as electronic health records, electrocardiograms, and medical images, increases, it is inevitable that healthcare will be revolutionized by this technology. Recently, generative AI has captivated the research community, leading to debates about its application in healthcare, mainly due to concerns about transparency and related issues. Meanwhile, concerns about the potential exacerbation of health disparities due to modeling biases have raised notable ethical concerns regarding the use of this technology in healthcare. However, the ethical principles for generative AI in healthcare have been understudied, and decision-makers often fail to consider the significance of generative AI. In this paper, we propose GREAT PLEA ethical principles, encompassing governance, reliability, equity, accountability, traceability, privacy, lawfulness, empathy, and autonomy, for generative AI in healthcare. We aim to proactively address the ethical dilemmas and challenges posed by the integration of generative AI in healthcare.",

Administrative data is additionally available to researchers raising the question of whether inferences about healthcare organizations based on the survey data can be enhanced by incorporating information from auxiliary data. Administrative data can provide information for dealing with under-coverage-bias and non-response in surveys and for capturing more sub-populations. In this study, we focus on the use of administrative claims data to improve estimates about means of survey items for the finite population. Auxiliary information from the claims data is incorporated using multiple imputation to impute values of non-responding or non-surveyed organizations. We derive multiple versions of imputation strategy, and the logical development of methodology is compared to two incumbent approaches: a na\\\"ive analysis that ignores the sampling probabilities and a traditional survey analysis weighting by the inverses of the sampling probabilities. , and illustrate the methods using data from The National Survey of Healthcare Organizations and Systems and The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Medicare claims data to make inferences about relationships of characteristics of healthcare organizations and healthcare services they provide.",

        "abstract": "Ethical frameworks for the use of natural language processing (NLP) are urgently needed to shape how large language models (LLMs) and similar tools are used for healthcare applications. Healthcare faces existing challenges including the balance of power in clinician-patient relationships, systemic health disparities, historical injustices, and economic constraints. Drawing directly from the voices of those most affected, and focusing on a case study of a specific healthcare setting, we propose a set of guiding principles for the use of NLP in maternal healthcare. We led an interactive session centered on an LLM-based chatbot demonstration during a full-day workshop with 39 participants, and additionally surveyed 30 healthcare workers and 30 birthing people about their values, needs, and perceptions of NLP tools in the context of maternal health. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analyses of the survey results and interactive discussions to consolidate our findings into a set of guiding principles. We propose nine principles for ethical use of NLP for maternal healthcare, grouped into three themes: (i) recognizing contextual significance (ii) holistic measurements, and (iii) who/what is valued. For each principle, we describe its underlying rationale and provide practical advice. This set of principles can provide a methodological pattern for other researchers and serve as a resource to practitioners working on maternal health and other healthcare fields to emphasize the importance of technical nuance, historical context, and inclusive design when developing NLP technologies for clinical use.",

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential in delivering accurate answers to questions about world knowledge. Despite this, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in healthcare predominantly focus on medical doctors, leaving other critical healthcare professions underrepresented. To fill this research gap, we introduce the Examinations for Medical Personnel in Chinese (EMPEC), a pioneering large-scale healthcare knowledge benchmark in traditional Chinese. EMPEC consists of 157,803 exam questions across 124 subjects and 20 healthcare professions, including underrepresented occupations like Optometrists and Audiologists. Each question is tagged with its release time and source, ensuring relevance and authenticity. We conducted extensive experiments on 17 LLMs, including proprietary, open-source models, general domain models and medical specific models, evaluating their performance under various settings. Our findings reveal that while leading models like GPT-4 achieve over 75\\% accuracy, they still struggle with specialized fields and alternative medicine. Surprisingly, general-purpose LLMs outperformed medical-specific models, and incorporating EMPEC's training data significantly enhanced performance. Additionally, the results on questions released after the models' training cutoff date were consistent with overall performance trends, suggesting that the models' performance on the test set can predict their effectiveness in addressing unseen healthcare-related queries. The transition from traditional to simplified Chinese characters had a negligible impact on model performance, indicating robust linguistic versatility. Our study underscores the importance of expanding benchmarks to cover a broader range of healthcare professions to better assess the applicability of LLMs in real-world healthcare scenarios.",

Today's undergraduate students are familiar with data science projects and they judge statistics against what they have seen.

This article provides a brief overview of data science, outlines ideas for how introductory courses could take inspiration from data science, and provides a reference to materials for developing stand-alone data science courses.",

        "abstract": "Data science is not a science. It is a research paradigm. Its power, scope, and scale will surpass science, our most powerful research paradigm, to enable knowledge discovery and change our world. We have yet to understand and define it, vital to realizing its potential and managing its risks. Modern data science is in its infancy. Emerging slowly since 1962 and rapidly since 2000, it is a fundamentally new field of inquiry, one of the most active, powerful, and rapidly evolving 21st century innovations. Due to its value, power, and applicability, it is emerging in over 40 disciplines, hundreds of research areas, and thousands of applications. Millions of data science publications contain myriad definitions of data science and data science problem solving. Due to its infancy, many definitions are independent, application specific, mutually incomplete, redundant, or inconsistent, hence so is data science. This research addresses this data science multiple definitions challenge by proposing the development of coherent, unified definition based on a data science reference framework using a data science journal for the data science community to achieve such a definition. This paper provides candidate definitions for essential data science artifacts that are required to discuss such a definition. They are based on the classical research paradigm concept consisting of a philosophy of data science, the data science problem solving paradigm, and the six component data science reference framework (axiology, ontology, epistemology, methodology, methods, technology) that is a frequently called for unifying framework with which to define, unify, and evolve data science. It presents challenges for defining data science, solution approaches, i.e., means for defining data science, and their requirements and benefits as the basis of a comprehensive solution.",

An appropriate understanding of data DNA and its organisms relies on the new field of data science and its keystone, analytics. Although it is widely debated whether big data is only hype and buzz, and data science is still in a very early phase, significant challenges and opportunities are emerging or have been inspired by the research, innovation, business, profession, and education of data science. This paper provides a comprehensive survey and tutorial of the fundamental aspects of data science: the evolution from data analysis to data science, the data science concepts, a big picture of the era of data science, the major challenges and directions in data innovation, the nature of data analytics, new industrialization and service opportunities in the data economy, the profession and competency of data education, and the future of data science.

        "abstract": "In the data science courses at the University of British Columbia, we define data science as the study, development and practice of reproducible and auditable processes to obtain insight from data. While reproducibility is core to our definition, most data science learners enter the field with other aspects of data science in mind, for example predictive modelling, which is often one of the most interesting topic to novices. This fact, along with the highly technical nature of the industry standard reproducibility tools currently employed in data science, present out-of-the gate challenges in teaching reproducibility in the data science classroom. Put simply, students are not as intrinsically motivated to learn this topic, and it is not an easy one for them to learn. What can a data science educator do? Over several iterations of teaching courses focused on reproducible data science tools and workflows, we have found that providing extra motivation, guided instruction and lots of practice are key to effectively teaching this challenging, yet important subject. Here we present examples of how we deeply motivate, effectively guide and provide ample practice opportunities to data science students to effectively engage them in learning about this topic.",

Additionally, data scientists have become ubiquitous in the private market, academic environments and even as a hobby. All of these trends are on a steady rise, and are associated with an increase in power consumption and associated carbon footprint. The increasing carbon footprint of large-scale advanced data science has already received attention, but the latter trend has not. This work aims to estimate the contribution of the increasingly popular \"common\" data science to the global carbon footprint. To this end, the power consumption of several typical tasks in the aforementioned common data science tasks will be measured and compared to: large-scale \"advanced\" data science, common computer-related tasks, and everyday non-computer related tasks. This is done by converting the measurements to the equivalent unit of \"km driven by car\". Our main findings are: \"common\" data science consumes $2.57$ more power than regular computer usage, but less than some common everyday power-consuming tasks such as lighting or heating; large-scale data science consumes substantially more power than common data science.",

While prior work has modeled how data science teams, oftentimes with distinct roles and work processes, communicate knowledge to outside stakeholders, we have little knowledge of how data science workers communicate intermediately before delivering the final products. In this work, we contribute a nuanced description of the intermediate communication process within data science teams. By analyzing interview data with 8 self-identified data science workers, we characterized the data science intermediate communication process with four factors, including the types of audience, communication goals, shared artifacts, and mode of communication. We also identified overarching challenges in the current communication process. We also discussed design implications that might inform better tools that facilitate intermediate communication within data science teams.",

Software engineering teams value adherence to coding standards as an indication of code readability, maintainability, and developer expertise. However, there are no large-scale empirical studies of coding standards focused specifically on Data Science projects. Aims: This study investigates the extent to which Data Science projects follow code standards. In particular, which standards are followed, which are ignored, and how does this differ to traditional software projects? Method: We compare a corpus of 1048 Open-Source Data Science projects to a reference group of 1099 non-Data Science projects with a similar level of quality and maturity. Results: Data Science projects suffer from a significantly higher rate of functions that use an excessive numbers of parameters and local variables. Data Science projects also follow different variable naming conventions to non-Data Science projects. Conclusions: The differences indicate that Data Science codebases are distinct from traditional software codebases and do not follow traditional software engineering conventions. Our conjecture is that this may be because traditional software engineering conventions are inappropriate in the context of Data Science projects.",

        "abstract": "A substantial fraction of students who complete their college education at a public university in the United States begin their journey at one of the 935 public two-year colleges. While the number of four-year colleges offering bachelor's degrees in data science continues to increase, data science instruction at many two-year colleges lags behind. A major impediment is the relative paucity of introductory data science courses that serve multiple student audiences and can easily transfer. In addition, the lack of pre-defined transfer pathways (or articulation agreements) for data science creates a growing disconnect that leaves students who want to study data science at a disadvantage. We describe opportunities and barriers to data science transfer pathways. Five points of curricular friction merit attention: 1) a first course in data science, 2) a second course in data science, 3) a course in scientific computing, data science workflow, and/or reproducible computing, 4) lab sciences, and 5) navigating communication, ethics, and application domain requirements in the context of general education and liberal arts course mappings. We catalog existing transfer pathways, efforts to align curricula across institutions, obstacles to overcome with minimally-disruptive solutions, and approaches to foster these pathways. Improvements in these areas are critically important to ensure that a broad and diverse set of students are able to engage and succeed in undergraduate data science programs.",

We show how organizational actors establish and re-negotiate trust under messy and uncertain analytic conditions through practices of skepticism, assessment, and credibility. Highlighting the collaborative and heterogeneous nature of real-world data science, we show how the management of trust in applied corporate data science settings depends not only on pre-processing and quantification, but also on negotiation and translation.

        "abstract": "Today, the prominence of data science within organizations has given rise to teams of data science workers collaborating on extracting insights from data, as opposed to individual data scientists working alone. However, we still lack a deep understanding of how data science workers collaborate in practice. In this work, we conducted an online survey with 183 participants who work in various aspects of data science. We focused on their reported interactions with each other (e.g., managers with engineers) and with different tools (e.g., Jupyter Notebook). We found that data science teams are extremely collaborative and work with a variety of stakeholders and tools during the six common steps of a data science workflow (e.g., clean data and train model). We also found that the collaborative practices workers employ, such as documentation, vary according to the kinds of tools they use. Based on these findings, we discuss design implications for supporting data science team collaborations and future research directions.",

        "abstract": "Data science is not a science. It is a research paradigm with an unfathomed scope, scale, complexity, and power for knowledge discovery that is not otherwise possible and can be beyond human reasoning. It is changing our world practically and profoundly already widely deployed in tens of thousands of applications in every discipline in an AI Arms Race that, due to its inscrutability, can lead to unfathomed risks. This paper presents an axiology of data science, its purpose, nature, importance, risks, and value for problem solving, by exploring and evaluating its remarkable, definitive features. As data science is in its infancy, this initial, speculative axiology is intended to aid in understanding and defining data science to recognize its potential benefits, risks, and open research challenges. AI based data science is inherently about uncertainty that may be more realistic than our preference for the certainty of science. Data science will have impacts far beyond knowledge discovery and will take us into new ways of understanding the world.",

        "abstract": "LLMs are transforming software development, yet current code generation and code repair benchmarks mainly assess syntactic and functional correctness in simple, single-error cases. LLMs' capabilities to autonomously find and fix runtime logical errors in complex data science code remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce DSDBench: the Data Science Debugging Benchmark, the first benchmark for systematic evaluation of LLMs on multi-hop error tracing and multi-bug detection in data science code debugging. DSDBench adapts datasets from existing data science task benchmarks, such as DABench and MatPlotBench, featuring realistic data science debugging tasks with automatically synthesized multi-hop, multi-bug code snippets. DSDBench includes 1,117 annotated samples with 741 cause-effect error pairs and runtime error messages. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on DSDBench show significant performance gaps, highlighting challenges in debugging logical runtime errors in data science code. DSDBench offers a crucial resource to evaluate and improve LLMs' debugging and reasoning capabilities, enabling more reliable AI-assisted data science in the future.

Data Science is in its initial phase, possibly being part of formal sciences and also being presented as part of applied sciences, capable of generating value and supporting decision making. Data Science considers science and, consequently, the scientific method to promote decision making through data intelligence. In many cases, the application of the method (or part of it) is considered in Data Science projects in scientific domain (social sciences, bioinformatics, geospatial projects) or business domain (finance, logistic, retail), among others. In this sense, this article addresses the perspectives of Data Science as a multidisciplinary area, considering science and the scientific method, and its formal structure which integrate Statistics, Computer Science, and Business Science, also taking into account Artificial Intelligence, emphasizing Machine Learning, among others. The article also deals with the perspective of applied Data Science, since Data Science is used for generating value through scientific and business projects.

Having such a vague characterization of a field in the early stages might be natural, but over time maintaining such a broad definition becomes unwieldy and impedes progress. In particular, the teaching of data science is hampered by the seeming need to cover many different points of interest. Data scientists must ultimately identify the core of the field by determining what makes the field unique and what it means to develop new knowledge in data science. In this review we attempt to distill some core ideas from data science by focusing on the iterative process of data analysis and develop some generalizations from past experience. Generalizations of this nature could form the basis of a theory of data science and would serve to unify and scale the teaching of data science to large audiences.",

In this paper, we argue that accessibility should be taught as early as the introductory course as part of the data science curriculum so that regardless of whether learners major in data science or not, they can have foundational exposure to accessibility. As data science educators who teach accessibility as part of our lower-division courses in two different institutions, we share specific examples that can be utilized by other data science instructors.",

In the Data Science for Social Good Summer program, graduate students mentor a group of undergraduate fellows as they tackle a data science project with positive social impact. In the Inclusive Mentoring in Data Science course, graduate students participate in workshops on effective and inclusive mentorship strategies. In an experiential learning framework, they are paired with undergraduate students from non-R1 schools, who they mentor through weekly one-on-one on-line meetings.

        "abstract": "Data Science is a complex and evolving field, but most agree that it can be defined as a combination of expertise drawn from three broad areascomputer science and technology, math and statistics, and domain knowledge -- with the purpose of extracting knowledge and value from data. Beyond this, the field is often defined as a series of practical activities ranging from the cleaning and wrangling of data, to its analysis and use to infer models, to the visual and rhetorical representation of results to stakeholders and decision-makers. This essay proposes a model of data science that goes beyond laundry-list definitions to get at the specific nature of data science and help distinguish it from adjacent fields such as computer science and statistics. We define data science as an interdisciplinary field comprising four broad areas of expertise: value, design, systems, and analytics. A fifth area, practice, integrates the other four in specific contexts of domain knowledge. We call this the 4+1 model of data science. Together, these areas belong to every data science project, even if they are often unconnected and siloed in the academy.",

It is important to equip university students with these essential data skills. To learn, design, and develop data visualization, students need knowledge of programming and data science topics. Many university programs lack dedicated data science courses for undergraduate students, making it important to introduce these concepts through integrated courses. However, combining data science and data visualization into one course can be challenging due to the time constraints and the heavy load of learning. In this paper, we discuss the development of teaching data science and data visualization together in one course and share the results of the post-course evaluation survey. From the survey's results, we identified four challenges, including difficulty in learning multiple tools and diverse data science topics, varying proficiency levels with tools and libraries, and selecting and cleaning datasets. We also distilled five opportunities for developing a successful data science and visualization course. These opportunities include clarifying the course structure, emphasizing visualization literacy early in the course, updating the course content according to student needs, using large real-world datasets, learning from industry professionals, and promoting collaboration among students.",

By integrating behavior change theories from cognitive psychology with data science workflow knowledge and ethics guidelines, we present a new perspective on responsible data science. We present example data science interventions in machine learning and visual data analysis, contextualized in behavior change theories that could be implemented to interrupt and redirect potentially suboptimal or negligent practices while reinforcing ethically conscious behaviors.

Geospatial Data Science, which derives geographic knowledge and insights from large volumes of geospatial big data using advanced Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI), has been widely used to tackle a wide range of geographic problems. However, it often overlooks the subjective human experiences that fundamentally influence human-environment interactions, and few strategies have been developed to ensure that these technologies follow ethical guidelines and prioritize human values. Human-centered Geospatial Data Science advocates for two primary focuses. First, it advances our understanding of human-environment interactions by leveraging Geospatial Data Science to measure and analyze human subjective experiences at place including emotion, perception, cognition, and creativity. Second, it advocates for the development of responsible and ethical Geospatial Data Science methods that protect geoprivacy, enhance fairness and reduce bias, and improve the explainability and transparency of geospatial technologies. With these two missions, Human-centered Geospatial Data Sciences brings a fresh perspective to develop and utilize geospatial technologies that positively impact society and benefit human well-being and the humanities.",

        "abstract": "This manuscript provides a holistic (data-centric) view of what we term essential data science, as a natural ecosystem with challenges and missions stemming from the data universe with its multiple combinations of the 5D complexities (data structure, domain, cardinality, causality, and ethics) with the phases of the data life cycle. Data agents perform tasks driven by specific goals. The data scientist is an abstract entity that comes from the logical organization of data agents with their actions. Data scientists face challenges that are defined according to the missions. We define specific discipline-induced data science, which in turn allows for the definition of pan-data science, a natural ecosystem that integrates specific disciplines with the essential data science. We semantically split the essential data science into computational, and foundational. We claim that there is a serious threat of divergence between computational and foundational data science. Especially, if no approach is taken to rate whether a data universe discovery should be useful or not. We suggest that rigorous approaches to measure the usefulness of data universe discoveries might mitigate such a divergence.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the data science community has pursued excellence and made significant research efforts to develop advanced analytics, focusing on solving technical problems at the expense of organizational and socio-technical challenges. According to previous surveys on the state of data science project management, there is a significant gap between technical and organizational processes. In this article we present new empirical data from a survey to 237 data science professionals on the use of project management methodologies for data science. We provide additional profiling of the survey respondents' roles and their priorities when executing data science projects. Based on this survey study, the main findings are: (1) Agile data science lifecycle is the most widely used framework, but only 25% of the survey participants state to follow a data science project methodology. (2) The most important success factors are precisely describing stakeholders' needs, communicating the results to end-users, and team collaboration and coordination. (3) Professionals who adhere to a project methodology place greater emphasis on the project's potential risks and pitfalls, version control, the deployment pipeline to production, and data security and privacy.",

        "abstract": "While coursework provides undergraduate data science students with some relevant analytic skills, many are not given the rich experiences with data and computing they need to be successful in the workplace. Additionally, students often have limited exposure to team-based data science and the principles and tools of collaboration that are encountered outside of school. In this paper, we describe the DSC-WAV program, an NSF-funded data science workforce development project in which teams of undergraduate sophomores and juniors work with a local non-profit organization on a data-focused problem. To help students develop a sense of agency and improve confidence in their technical and non-technical data science skills, the project promoted a team-based approach to data science, adopting several processes and tools intended to facilitate this collaboration. Evidence from the project evaluation, including participant survey and interview data, is presented to document the degree to which the project was successful in engaging students in team-based data science, and how the project changed the students' perceptions of their technical and non-technical skills. We also examine opportunities for improvement and offer insight to other data science educators who may want to implement a similar team-based approach to data science projects at their own institutions.",

        "abstract": "Data science has employed great research efforts in developing advanced analytics, improving data models and cultivating new algorithms. However, not many authors have come across the organizational and socio-technical challenges that arise when executing a data science project: lack of vision and clear objectives, a biased emphasis on technical issues, a low level of maturity for ad-hoc projects and the ambiguity of roles in data science are among these challenges. Few methodologies have been proposed on the literature that tackle these type of challenges, some of them date back to the mid-1990, and consequently they are not updated to the current paradigm and the latest developments in big data and machine learning technologies. In addition, fewer methodologies offer a complete guideline across team, project and data & information management. In this article we would like to explore the necessity of developing a more holistic approach for carrying out data science projects. We first review methodologies that have been presented on the literature to work on data science projects and classify them according to the their focus: project, team, data and information management. Finally, we propose a conceptual framework containing general characteristics that a methodology for managing data science projects with a holistic point of view should have. This framework can be used by other researchers as a roadmap for the design of new data science methodologies or the updating of existing ones.",

Although ethics can help data scientists reflect on certain normative aspects of their work, such efforts are ill-equipped to generate a data science that avoids social harms and promotes social justice. In this article, I argue that data science must embrace a political orientation. Data scientists must recognize themselves as political actors engaged in normative constructions of society and evaluate their work according to its downstream impacts on people's lives. I first articulate why data scientists must recognize themselves as political actors. In this section, I respond to three arguments that data scientists commonly invoke when challenged to take political positions regarding their work. In confronting these arguments, I describe why attempting to remain apolitical is itself a political stance--a fundamentally conservative one--and why data science's attempts to promote \"social good\" dangerously rely on unarticulated and incrementalist political assumptions. I then propose a framework for how data science can evolve toward a deliberative and rigorous politics of social justice. I conceptualize the process of developing a politically engaged data science as a sequence of four stages. Pursuing these new approaches will empower data scientists with new methods for thoughtfully and rigorously contributing to social justice.",

Moreover, data science, implemented carefully, opens accessible pathways to stem for students for whom neither mathematics nor computer science are natural affinities, and who would traditionally be excluded. We discuss a proposal for the stealth development of computational skills in students' first exposure to data science through careful, scaffolded exposure to computation and its power. The intent of this approach is to support students, regardless of interest and self-efficacy in coding, in becoming data-driven learners, who are capable of asking complex questions about the world around them, and then answering those questions through the use of data-driven inquiry. This discussion is presented in the context of the International Data Science in Schools Project which recently published computer science and statistics consensus curriculum frameworks for a two-year secondary school data science program, designed to make data science accessible to all.",

The latest wave of data science research, pertaining to machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), is growing exponentially and garnering millions of annual citations. However, this growth has been accompanied by a diminishing emphasis on social good challenges - our analysis reveals that the proportion of data science research focusing on social good is less than it has ever been. At the same time, the proliferation of machine learning and generative AI have sparked debates about the socio-technical prospects and challenges associated with data science for human flourishing, organizations, and society. Against this backdrop, we present a framework for \"data science for social good\" (DSSG) research that considers the interplay between relevant data science research genres, social good challenges, and different levels of socio-technical abstraction. We perform an analysis of the literature to empirically demonstrate the paucity of work on DSSG in information systems (and other related disciplines) and highlight current impediments. We then use our proposed framework to introduce the articles appearing in the special issue. We hope that this article and the special issue will spur future DSSG research and help reverse the alarming trend across data science research over the past 30-plus years in which social good challenges are garnering proportionately less attention with each passing day.",

Recently, many data science benchmarks have been proposed to investigate their performance in the data science domain. However, existing data science benchmarks still fall short when compared to real-world data science applications due to their simplified settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce DSBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate data science agents with realistic tasks. This benchmark includes 466 data analysis tasks and 74 data modeling tasks, sourced from Eloquence and Kaggle competitions. DSBench offers a realistic setting by encompassing long contexts, multimodal task backgrounds, reasoning with large data files and multi-table structures, and performing end-to-end data modeling tasks. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, LVLMs, and agents shows that they struggle with most tasks, with the best agent solving only 34.12% of data analysis tasks and achieving a 34.74% Relative Performance Gap (RPG). These findings underscore the need for further advancements in developing more practical, intelligent, and autonomous data science agents.",

As faculty at baccalaureate institutions (where the growth of undergraduate statistics programs has been dramatic), we are keen to ensure statistics has a place in data science and data science education.

        "abstract": "Nolan and Temple Lang (2010) argued for the fundamental role of computing in the statistics curriculum. In the intervening decade the statistics education community has acknowledged that computational skills are as important to statistics and data science practice as mathematics. There remains a notable gap, however, between our intentions and our actions. In this special issue of the *Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education* we have assembled a collection of papers that (1) suggest creative structures to integrate computing, (2) describe novel data science skills and habits, and (3) propose ways to teach computational thinking. We believe that it is critical for the community to redouble our efforts to embrace sophisticated computing in the statistics and data science curriculum. We hope that these papers provide useful guidance for the community to move these efforts forward.",

        "abstract": "A growing number of students are completing undergraduate degrees in statistics and entering the workforce as data analysts. In these positions, they are expected to understand how to utilize databases and other data warehouses, scrape data from Internet sources, program solutions to complex problems in multiple languages, and think algorithmically as well as statistically. These data science topics have not traditionally been a major component of undergraduate programs in statistics. Consequently, a curricular shift is needed to address additional learning outcomes. The goal of this paper is to motivate the importance of data science proficiency and to provide examples and resources for instructors to implement data science in their own statistics curricula. We provide case studies from seven institutions. These varied approaches to teaching data science demonstrate curricular innovations to address new needs. Also included here are examples of assignments designed for courses that foster engagement of undergraduates with data and data science.",

Within the new type of mathematization at work in data science, mathematical methods are not selected because of any relevance for a problem at hand; mathematical methods are applied to a specific problem only by 'forcing', i.e. on the basis of their ability to reorganize the data for further analysis and the intrinsic richness of their mathematical structure. In particular, we argue that deep learning neural networks are best understood within the context of forcing optimization methods. We finally explore the broader question of the appropriateness of data science methods in solving problems. We argue that this question should not be interpreted as a search for a correspondence between phenomena and specific solutions found by data science methods; rather, it is the internal structure of data science methods that is open to precise forms of understanding.",

There has been increasing desire on the part of data science educators to craft curricula that speak to these critiques, yet much ethics education remains individualized, focused on specific cases, or too abstract and unapplicable. We synthesized some of the most popular critical data science works and designed a data science ethics course that spoke to the social phenomena at the root of critical data studies -- theories of oppression, social systems, power, history, and change -- through analysis of a pressing sociotechnical system: surveillance systems. Through analysis of student reflections and final projects, we determined that at the conclusion of the semester, all students had developed critical analysis skills that allowed them to investigate surveillance systems of their own and identify their benefits, harms, main proponents, those who resist them, and their interplay with social systems, all while considering dimensions of race, class, gender, and more. We argue that this type of instruction -- directly teaching data science ethics alongside social theory -- is a crucial next step for the field.",

In this paper, we present novel approaches to teaching data science and visualization to blind students in an online setting. Taught by blind instructors, nine blind learners having a wide range of professional backgrounds participated in a two-week summer course. We describe the course design, teaching strategies, and learning outcomes. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities of teaching data science and visualization to blind students.

        "abstract": "The advent of foundation models (FMs) such as large language models (LLMs) has led to a cultural shift in data science, both in medicine and beyond. This shift involves moving away from specialized predictive models trained for specific, well-defined domain questions to generalist FMs pre-trained on vast amounts of unstructured data, which can then be adapted to various clinical tasks and questions. As a result, the standard data science workflow in medicine has been fundamentally altered; the foundation model lifecycle (FMLC) now includes distinct upstream and downstream processes, in which computational resources, model and data access, and decision-making power are distributed among multiple stakeholders. At their core, FMs are fundamentally statistical models, and this new workflow challenges the principles of Veridical Data Science (VDS), hindering the rigorous statistical analysis expected in transparent and scientifically reproducible data science practices. We critically examine the medical FMLC in light of the core principles of VDS: predictability, computability, and stability (PCS), and explain how it deviates from the standard data science workflow. Finally, we propose recommendations for a reimagined medical FMLC that expands and refines the PCS principles for VDS including considering the computational and accessibility constraints inherent to FMs.",

In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the evolution of data quality (DQ) awareness from traditional data management systems to modern data-driven AI systems, which are integral to data science. We synthesize the existing literature, highlighting the quality challenges and techniques that have evolved from traditional data management to data science including big data and ML fields. As data science systems support a wide range of activities, our focus in this paper lies specifically in the analytics aspect driven by machine learning. We use the cause-effect connection between the quality challenges of ML and those of big data to allow a more thorough understanding of emerging DQ challenges and the related quality awareness techniques in data science systems. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to provide a review of DQ awareness spanning traditional and emergent data science systems.

DSCodeBench consists of 1,000 carefully constructed problems sourced from realistic problems from GitHub across ten widely used Python data science libraries. Compared to the current state-of-the-art benchmark DS-1000, DSCodeBench offers a more challenging and representative testbed, longer code solutions, more comprehensive data science libraries, clearer and better structured problem descriptions, and stronger test suites. To construct the DSCodeBench, we develop a robust pipeline that combines task scope selection, code construction, test case generation, and problem description synthesis. The process is paired with rigorous manual editing to ensure alignment and enhance evaluation reliability. Experimental result shows that DSCodeBench exhibits robust scaling behavior, where larger models systematically outperform smaller ones, validating its ability to distinguish model capabilities. The best LLM we test, GPT-4o, has a pass@1 of 0.202, indicating that LLMs still have a large room to improve for realistic data science code generation tasks. We believe DSCodeBench will serve as a rigorous and trustworthy foundation for advancing LLM-based data science programming.",

How do ethical principles (e.g., fairness, justice, beneficence, and non-maleficence) relate to our professional lives? What lies in our responsibility as professionals by our expertise in the field? More specifically this article makes an appeal to statisticians to join that debate, and to be part of the community that establishes data science as a proper profession in the sense of Airaksinen, a philosopher working on professional ethics. As we will argue, data science has one of its roots in statistics and extends beyond it. To shape the future of statistics, and to take responsibility for the statistical contributions to data science, statisticians should actively engage in the discussions. First the term data science is defined, and the technical changes that have led to a strong influence of data science on society are outlined. Next the systematic approach from CNIL is introduced. Prominent examples are given for ethical issues arising from the work of data scientists. Further we provide reasons why data scientists should engage in shaping morality around and to formulate codes of conduct and codes of practice for data science. Next we present established ethical guidelines for the related fields of statistics and computing machinery. Thereafter necessary steps in the community to develop professional ethics for data science are described. Finally we give our starting statement for the debate: Data science is in the focal point of current societal development. Without becoming a profession with professional ethics, data science will fail in building trust in its interaction with and its much needed contributions to society!",

Driven by a huge workforce demand, many academic institutions have started to offer degrees in data science, with many at the graduate, and a few at the undergraduate level. Curricula may differ at different institutions, because of varying levels of faculty expertise, and different disciplines (such as Math, computer science, and business etc) in developing the curriculum. The University of Massachusetts Dartmouth started offering degree programs in data science from Fall 2015, at both the undergraduate and the graduate level. Quite a few articles have been published that deal with graduate data science courses, much less so dealing with undergraduate ones. Our discussion will focus on undergraduate course structure and function, and specifically, a first course in data science. Our design of this course centers around a concept called the data science life cycle. That is, we view tasks or steps in the practice of data science as forming a process, consisting of states that indicate how it comes into life, how different tasks in data science depend on or interact with others until the birth of a data product or the reach of a conclusion. Naturally, different pieces of the data science life cycle then form individual parts of the course. Details of each piece are filled up by concepts, techniques, or skills that are popular in industry. Consequently, the design of our course is both \"principled\" and practical. A significant feature of our course philosophy is that, in line with activity theory, the course is based on the use of tools to transform real data in order to answer strongly motivated questions related to the data.",

However, academic statistics has often frowned upon data analyses with a causal objective. The introduction of the term \"data science\" provides a historic opportunity to redefine data analysis in such a way that it naturally accommodates causal inference from observational data. Like others before, we organize the scientific contributions of data science into three classes of tasks: Description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction (which includes causal inference). An explicit classification of data science tasks is necessary to discuss the data, assumptions, and analytics required to successfully accomplish each task. We argue that a failure to adequately describe the role of subject-matter expert knowledge in data analysis is a source of widespread misunderstandings about data science. Specifically, causal analyses typically require not only good data and algorithms, but also domain expert knowledge. We discuss the implications for the use of data science to guide decision-making in the real world and to train data scientists.",

When using and analyzing data, the scientists implicitly agree to follow standards, procedures, and rules set in these fields. However, guidance on the responsibilities of the data scientists and the other involved actors in a data science project is typically missing. While literature shows that novel frameworks and tools are being proposed in support of open-science, data reuse, and research data management, there are currently no frameworks that can fully express responsibilities of a data science project. In this paper, we describe the Transparency, Accountability, Privacy, and Societal Responsibility Matrix (TAPS-RM) as framework to explore social, legal, and ethical aspects of data science projects. TAPS-RM acts as a tool to provide users with a holistic view of their project beyond key outcomes and clarifies the responsibilities of actors. We map the developed model of TAPS-RM with well-known initiatives for open data (such as FACT, FAIR and Datasheets for datasets). We conclude that TAPS-RM is a tool to reflect on responsibilities at a data science project level and can be used to advance responsible data science by design.",

While tutorials and guidelines for novice data science are available on both platforms, there is a low number of Jupyter Notebooks that received high numbers of votes from the community. The high-voted notebook is considered well-documented, easy to understand, and applies the best data science and software engineering practices. In this research, we aim to understand the characteristics of high-voted Jupyter Notebooks on Kaggle and the popular Jupyter Notebooks for data science projects on GitHub. We plan to mine and analyse the Jupyter Notebooks on both platforms. We will perform exploratory analytics, data visualization, and feature importances to understand the overall structure of these notebooks and to identify common patterns and best-practice features separating the low-voted and high-voted notebooks. Upon the completion of this research, the discovered insights can be applied as training guidelines for aspiring data scientists and machine learning practitioners looking to improve their performance from novice ranking Jupyter Notebook on Kaggle to a deployable project on GitHub.",

        "abstract": "Cyber-security solutions are traditionally static and signature-based. The traditional solutions along with the use of analytic models, machine learning and big data could be improved by automatically trigger mitigation or provide relevant awareness to control or limit consequences of threats. This kind of intelligent solutions is covered in the context of Data Science for Cyber-security. Data Science provides a significant role in cyber-security by utilising the power of data (and big data), high-performance computing and data mining (and machine learning) to protect users against cyber-crimes. For this purpose, a successful data science project requires an effective methodology to cover all issues and provide adequate resources. In this paper, we are introducing popular data science methodologies and will compare them in accordance with cyber-security challenges. A comparison discussion has also delivered to explain methodologies strengths and weaknesses in case of cyber-security projects.",

This makes data science time consuming and restricted to experts with the resulting quality heavily dependent on their experience and skills. To make data science more accessible and scalable, we need its democratization. Automated Data Science (AutoDS) is aimed towards that goal and is emerging as an important research and business topic. We introduce and define the AutoDS challenge, followed by a proposal of a general AutoDS framework that covers existing approaches but also provides guidance for the development of new methods. We categorize and review the existing literature from multiple aspects of the problem setup and employed techniques. Then we provide several views on how AI could succeed in automating end-to-end AutoDS. We hope this survey can serve as insightful guideline for the AutoDS field and provide inspiration for future research.",

In this paper, we propose a methodology for categorizing and answering 'The Big Three' questions (what is going on, what is causing it, and what actions can I take that will optimize what I care about) using data science. The applications of data science seem to be nearly endless in today's modern landscape, with each company jockeying for position in the new data and insights economy. Yet, data scientists seem to be solely focused on using classification, regression, and clustering methods to answer the question 'what is going on'. Answering questions about why things are happening or how to take optimal actions to improve metrics are relegated to niche fields of research and generally neglected in industry data science analysis. We survey technical methods to answer these other important questions, describe areas in which some of these methods are being applied, and provide a practical example of how to apply our methodology and selected methods to a real business use case.",

Only till recently, machine learning(ML) researchers have developed promising automation techniques to aid data workers in these tasks. This paper introduces AutoDS, an automated machine learning (AutoML) system that aims to leverage the latest ML automation techniques to support data science projects. Data workers only need to upload their dataset, then the system can automatically suggest ML configurations, preprocess data, select algorithm, and train the model. These suggestions are presented to the user via a web-based graphical user interface and a notebook-based programming user interface.   We studied AutoDS with 30 professional data scientists, where one group used AutoDS, and the other did not, to complete a data science project. As expected, AutoDS improves productivity; Yet surprisingly, we find that the models produced by the AutoDS group have higher quality and less errors, but lower human confidence scores. We reflect on the findings by presenting design implications for incorporating automation techniques into human work in the data science lifecycle.",

        "abstract": "As data have become more prevalent in academia, industry, and daily life, it is imperative that undergraduate students are equipped with the skills needed to analyze data in the modern environment. In recent years there has been a lot of work innovating introductory statistics courses and developing introductory data science courses; however, there has been less work beyond the first course. This paper describes innovations to Regression Analysis taught at Duke University, a course focused on application that serves a diverse undergraduate student population of statistics and data science majors along with non-majors. Three principles guiding the modernization of the course are presented with details about how these principles align with the necessary skills of practice outlined in recent statistics and data science curriculum guidelines. The paper includes pedagogical strategies, motivated by the innovations in introductory courses, that make it feasible to implement skills for the practice of modern statistics and data science alongside fundamental statistical concepts. The paper concludes with the impact of these changes, challenges, and next steps for the course. Portions of in-class activities and assignments are included in the paper, with full sample assignments and resources for finding data in the supplemental materials.",

Machine learning is increasingly supporting the education system and educational data science (EDS) domain, from decision support to educational activities and learning analytics. However, the machine learning-based decisions can be biased because the algorithms may generate the results based on students' protected attributes such as race or gender. Clustering is an important machine learning technique to explore student data in order to support the decision-maker, as well as support educational activities, such as group assignments. Therefore, ensuring high-quality clustering models along with satisfying fairness constraints are important requirements. This chapter comprehensively surveys clustering models and their fairness in EDS. We especially focus on investigating the fair clustering models applied in educational activities. These models are believed to be practical tools for analyzing students' data and ensuring fairness in EDS.",

Increasing the accessibility of data science to these communities not only benefits the individuals entering data science, but also increases the field's innovation and potential impact as a whole. Education is the most scalable solution to meet these needs, but many data science educators lack formal training in education. Our group has led education efforts for a variety of audiences: from professional scientists to high school students to lay audiences. These experiences have helped form our teaching philosophy which we have summarized into three main ideals: 1) motivation, 2) inclusivity, and 3) realism. To put these ideals better into practice, we also aim to iteratively update our teaching approaches and curriculum as we find ways to better reach these ideals. In this manuscript we discuss these ideals as well practical ideas for how to implement these philosophies in the classroom.",

However, such gradient methods face diverging optimality gaps or exploding objective evaluations when applied to optimization problems with realistic properties for data science applications. In this work, we address this gap by developing a generic methodology that economically uses objective function evaluations in a problem-driven manner to prevent optimality gap divergence and avoid explosions in objective evaluations. Our methodology allows for a variety of step size routines and search direction strategies. Furthermore, we develop a particular, novel step size selection methodology that is well-suited to our framework. We show that our specific procedure is highly competitive with standard optimization methods on CUTEst test problems. We then show our specific procedure is highly favorable relative to standard optimization methods on a particularly tough data science problem: learning the parameters in a generalized estimating equation model. Thus, we provide a novel gradient methodology that is better suited to optimization problems from this important class of data science applications.",

First, we delineate the approach in more theoretical detail, by discussing how the goal of RCR training is to foster the cultivation of certain moral abilities. We specify the nature of these abilities: while the ideal is the cultivation of virtues, the limited space allowed by RCR modules can only facilitate the cultivation of superficial abilities or proto-virtues, which help students to familiarize with moral and political issues in the data science environment. Third, we operationalize our approach by stressing that (proto-)virtue acquisition (like skill acquisition) occurs through the technical and social tasks of daily data science activities, where these repetitive tasks provide the opportunities to develop (proto-)virtue capacity and to support the development of ethically robust data systems. Finally, we discuss a concrete example of how this approach has been implemented. In particular, we describe how this method is applied to teach data ethics to students participating in the CODATA-RDA Data Science Summer Schools.",

However, the exploratory nature of data science, alongside the stochastic and opaque outputs of LLMs, raise concerns about their reliability. While prior work focuses on benchmarking LLM accuracy, reproducibility remains underexplored, despite being critical to establishing trust in LLM-driven analysis.   We propose a novel analyst-inspector framework to automatically evaluate and enforce the reproducibility of LLM-generated data science workflows - the first rigorous approach to the best of our knowledge. Defining reproducibility as the sufficiency and completeness of workflows for reproducing functionally equivalent code, this framework enforces computational reproducibility principles, ensuring transparent, well-documented LLM workflows while minimizing reliance on implicit model assumptions.   Using this framework, we systematically evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs on 1,032 data analysis tasks across three diverse benchmark datasets. We also introduce two novel reproducibility-enhancing prompting strategies. Our results show that higher reproducibility strongly correlates with improved accuracy and reproducibility-enhancing prompts are effective, demonstrating structured prompting's potential to enhance automated data science workflows and enable transparent, robust AI-driven analysis.

We propose DatawiseAgent, a notebook-centric LLM agent framework that unifies interactions among user, agent and the computational environment through markdown and executable code cells, supporting flexible and adaptive automated data science. Built on a Finite State Transducer(FST), DatawiseAgent orchestrates four stages, including DSF-like planning, incremental execution, self-debugging, and post-filtering. Specifically, the DFS-like planning stage systematically explores the solution space, while incremental execution harnesses real-time feedback and accommodates LLM's limited capabilities to progressively complete tasks. The self-debugging and post-filtering modules further enhance reliability by diagnosing and correcting errors and pruning extraneous information. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including data analysis, visualization, and data modeling, show that DatawiseAgent consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods across multiple model settings. These results highlight its potential to generalize across data science scenarios and lay the groundwork for more efficient, fully automated workflows.",

We conducted a case study at the e-commerce company Elo7 to answer the research question: How can the agility of the XP method be integrated with CRISP-DM in Data Science projects? Data was collected through interviews and questionnaires with a Data Science team consisting of data scientists, ML engineers, and data product managers. The results show that 86% of the team frequently or always applies CRISP-DM, while 71% adopt XP practices in their projects. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that it is possible to combine CRISP-DM with XP in Data Science projects, providing a structured and collaborative approach. Finally, the study generated improvement recommendations for the company.",

        "abstract": "Data science aims to extract insights from data to support decision-making processes. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as assistants for data science, by suggesting ideas, techniques and small code snippets, or for the interpretation of results and reporting. Proper automation of some data-science activities is now promised by the rise of LLM agents, i.e., AI systems powered by an LLM equipped with additional affordances--such as code execution and knowledge bases--that can perform self-directed actions and interact with digital environments. In this paper, we survey the evaluation of LLM assistants and agents for data science. We find (1) a dominant focus on a small subset of goal-oriented activities, largely ignoring data management and exploratory activities; (2) a concentration on pure assistance or fully autonomous agents, without considering intermediate levels of human-AI collaboration; and (3) an emphasis on human substitution, therefore neglecting the possibility of higher levels of automation thanks to task transformation.",

We discuss applications, solution methods, dimensional reduction techniques and some of their limits.

In this work, we introduce persistent Stanley-Reisner theory to bridge commutative algebra, combinatorial algebraic topology, machine learning, and data science. We propose persistent h-vectors, persistent f-vectors, persistent graded Betti numbers, persistent facet ideals, and facet persistence modules. Stability analysis indicates that these algebraic invariants are stable against geometric perturbations.
