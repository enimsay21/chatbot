Previously, machine learning and blockchain have been considered two independent technologies without an obvious link. Second, it proposes a unified analytical framework for trustable machine learning by using blockchain technology. This unified framework solves both the trustability and automation issues in machine learning. Third, it enables a computer to translate core machine learning implementation from a single thread on a single machine to multiple threads on multiple machines running with blockchain by using a unified approach.

Therefore, there is a need to look into the interpretability problem of machine learning in the context of questions that need to be addressed rather than different tools. We discuss about a hypothetical interpretability framework driven by a question based scientific approach rather than some specific machine learning model.

However, annotating medical image segmentation datasets is expensive due to the requirement of professional skills. Additionally, classes are often unevenly distributed in medical images, which severely affects the classification performance on minority classes. To address these problems, this paper proposes Co-Distribution Alignment (Co-DA) for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Specifically, Co-DA aligns marginal predictions on unlabeled data to marginal predictions on labeled data in a class-wise manner with two differently initialized models before using the pseudo-labels generated by one model to supervise the other. Besides, we design an over-expectation cross-entropy loss for filtering the unlabeled pixels to reduce noise in their pseudo-labels. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods on both the 2D CaDIS dataset and the 3D LGE-MRI and ACDC datasets, achieving an mIoU of 0.8515 with only 24% labeled data on CaDIS, and a Dice score of 0.8824 and 0.8773 with only 20% data on LGE-MRI and ACDC, respectively.', 2023, 'ArXiv', '', 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12630v1', 'cs.CV', 'cs.CV', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.12630v1'),

In initial phase of research, major focus has been given to review existing deep-learning approaches, including researches like MultiResUNet, Attention U-Net, classical U-Net, and other variants.

However, these models often fail to generalize on the free-hand sketches, leading to unsatisfactory results. In this paper, we propose a practical free-hand sketch-to-image generation model called Sketch2MedI that learns to represent sketches in StyleGAN\'s latent space and generate medical images from it.

While ample research on mathematical modeling education and published textbooks on the topic are available, there is a lack of focus on mathematical modeling for sustainability. This review aims to address this gap by exploring the powerful intersection of mathematical modeling and sustainability. Mathematical modeling for sustainability connects two distinct realms: learning about the mathematics of sustainability and promoting sustainable learning in mathematics education. The former involves teaching and learning sustainability quantitatively, while the latter encompasses pedagogy that enables learners to apply quantitative knowledge and skills to everyday life and continue learning and improving mathematically beyond formal education. To demonstrate the practical application of mathematical modeling for sustainability, we discuss a specific textbook suitable for a pilot liberal arts course. We illustrate how learners can grasp mathematical concepts related to sustainability through simple yet mathematically diverse examples, which can be further developed for teaching such a course.

However, in many applications, users require an explanation of the Artificial Intelligences decision. This led to increased demand for Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence. Knowledge Graphs epitomize fertile soil for Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence, due to their ability to display connected data, i.e. knowledge, in a human- as well as machine-readable way. This survey gives a short history to Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs. Furthermore, we contribute by arguing that the concept Explainable Artificial Intelligence is overloaded and overlapping with Interpretable Machine Learning. By introducing the parent concept Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence, we provide a clear-cut distinction of both concepts while accounting for their similarities. Thus, we provide in this survey a case for Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs consisting of Interpretable Machine Learning on Knowledge Graphs and Explainable Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs. This leads to the introduction of a novel taxonomy for Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs.

We discuss the potential of artificial intelligence in revolutionizing numerical weather prediction, and briefly outlining the underlying reasons for its great potential. While acknowledging the high accuracy, computational efficiency, and ease of deployment of large artificial intelligence forecast models, we also emphasize the irreplaceable values of traditional numerical forecasts and explore the challenges in the future development of large-scale artificial intelligence atmosphere-ocean forecast models. We believe that the optimal future of atmosphere-ocean weather forecast lies in achieving a seamless integration of artificial intelligence and traditional numerical models.

This model implies the following: let A be the level of development of artificial intelligence. Then, the moment of technological singularity n is defined as the point in time where artificial intelligence development function approaches infinity. Thus, it happens in finite time. Although infinite level of development of artificial intelligence cannot be reached practically, this approximation is useful for several reasons, firstly because it allows modeling a phase transition or a change of regime. In the model, intelligence growth function appears to be hyperbolic function under relatively broad conditions which we list and compare.

There exists vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science of how people define, generate, select, evaluate, and present explanations, which argues that people employ certain cognitive biases and social expectations towards the explanation process. This paper argues that the field of explainable artificial intelligence should build on this existing research, and reviews relevant papers from philosophy, cognitive psychology/science, and social psychology, which study these topics. It draws out some important findings, and discusses ways that these can be infused with work on explainable artificial intelligence.', 2017, 'ArXiv', '', 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07269v3', 'cs.AI', 'cs.AI', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.07269v3'),

This can be achieved by using artificial intelligence methods that provide flexibility and learning capability. The likelihood of developing cyber defense capabilities through increased intelligence of defense systems is quite high. Given the problems associated with cyber defense in real life, it is clear that many cyber defense problems can be successfully solved only when artificial intelligence methods are used. In this article, the current artificial intelligence practices and techniques are reviewed and the use and importance of artificial intelligence in cyber defense systems is mentioned.

We explore specialized pre-training to adapt smaller LLMs to different healthcare datasets. Three methods are assessed: traditional masked language modeling, Deep Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Textual Representations (DeCLUTR), and a novel pre-training objective utilizing metadata categories from the healthcare settings. These schemes are evaluated on downstream document classification tasks for each dataset, with additional analysis of the resultant embedding spaces. Contrastively trained models outperform other approaches on the classification tasks, delivering strong performance from limited labeled data and with fewer model parameter updates required. While metadata-based pre-training does not further improve classifications across the datasets, it yields interesting embedding cluster separability.

By analyzing millions of patients\' electronic medical records across US states, we find that the COVID-19 pandemic caused two successive waves of disruptions within the healthcare systems, enabling natural experiment analysis of the adaptive capacity for each system to adapt to past disruptions. We generalize the quantification framework and find that the US healthcare systems exhibit substantial adaptability but only a moderate level of resilience.

These questions are the most challenging for current QA systems, and the current performance of the state-of-the-art method is slightly better than a random guess. In order to solve this challenging task, we present a Multi-step reasoning with Knowledge extraction framework (MurKe).

Some have viewed this increase as an attempt not to expand the patients\' choices but to privatize public healthcare. This debate poses a social dilemma whether the NHS should stop cooperating with Private providers. This paper contributes to healthcare economic modelling by investigating the evolution of cooperation among three proposed populations: Public Healthcare Providers, Private Healthcare Providers and Patients. The Patient population is included as a main player in the decision-making process by expanding patient\'s choices of treatment. We develop a generic basic model that measures the cost of healthcare provision based on given parameters, such as NHS and private healthcare providers\' cost of investments in both sectors, cost of treatments and gained benefits. A patient\'s costly punishment is introduced as a mechanism to enhance cooperation among the three populations. Our findings show that cooperation can be improved with the introduction of punishment (patient\'s punishment) against defecting providers.

Having such a vague characterization of a field in the early stages might be natural, but over time maintaining such a broad definition becomes unwieldy and impedes progress. In particular, the teaching of data science is hampered by the seeming need to cover many different points of interest. Data scientists must ultimately identify the core of the field by determining what makes the field unique and what it means to develop new knowledge in data science. In this review we attempt to distill some core ideas from data science by focusing on the iterative process of data analysis and develop some generalizations from past experience. Generalizations of this nature could form the basis of a theory of data science and would serve to unify and scale the teaching of data science to large audiences.', 2021, 'ArXiv', '', 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06324v1', 'stat.OT, stat.AP', 'stat.OT, stat.AP', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.06324v1'),

This essay proposes a model of data science that goes beyond laundry-list definitions to get at the specific nature of data science and help distinguish it from adjacent fields such as computer science and statistics. We define data science as an interdisciplinary field comprising four broad areas of expertise: value, design, systems, and analytics.

It is important to equip university students with these essential data skills. To learn, design, and develop data visualization, students need knowledge of programming and data science topics. Many university programs lack dedicated data science courses for undergraduate students, making it important to introduce these concepts through integrated courses. However, combining data science and data visualization into one course can be challenging due to the time constraints and the heavy load of learning. In this paper, we discuss the development of teaching data science and data visualization together in one course and share the results of the post-course evaluation survey. From the survey\'s results, we identified four challenges, including difficulty in learning multiple tools and diverse data science topics, varying proficiency levels with tools and libraries, and selecting and cleaning datasets.

Data agents perform tasks driven by specific goals. The data scientist is an abstract entity that comes from the logical organization of data agents with their actions. Data scientists face challenges that are defined according to the missions. We define specific discipline-induced data science, which in turn allows for the definition of pan-data science, a natural ecosystem that integrates specific disciplines with the essential data science. We semantically split the essential data science into computational, and foundational. We claim that there is a serious threat of divergence between computational and foundational data science.

As a result, the standard data science workflow in medicine has been fundamentally altered; the foundation model lifecycle (FMLC) now includes distinct upstream and downstream processes, in which computational resources, model and data access, and decision-making power are distributed among multiple stakeholders.

We propose a novel analyst-inspector framework to automatically evaluate and enforce the reproducibility of LLM-generated data science workflows - the first rigorous approach to the best of our knowledge. Defining reproducibility as the sufficiency and completeness of workflows for reproducing functionally equivalent code, this framework enforces computational reproducibility principles, ensuring transparent, well-documented LLM workflows while minimizing reliance on implicit model assumptions.   Using this framework, we systematically evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs on 1,032 data analysis tasks across three diverse benchmark datasets. We also introduce two novel reproducibility-enhancing prompting strategies. Our results show that higher reproducibility strongly correlates with improved accuracy and reproducibility-enhancing prompts are effective, demonstrating structured prompting\'s potential to enhance automated data science workflows and enable transparent, robust AI-driven analysis. Our code is publicly available.', 2025, 'ArXiv', '', 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16395v1', 'cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.HC', 'cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.HC', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16395v1'),

Existing LLM-based approaches largely concentrate on isolated phases, neglecting the interdependent nature of many data science tasks and limiting their capacity for comprehensive end-to-end support. We propose DatawiseAgent, a notebook-centric LLM agent framework that unifies interactions among user, agent and the computational environment through markdown and executable code cells, supporting flexible and adaptive automated data science. Built on a Finite State Transducer(FST), DatawiseAgent orchestrates four stages, including DSF-like planning, incremental execution, self-debugging, and post-filtering. Specifically, the DFS-like planning stage systematically explores the solution space, while incremental execution harnesses real-time feedback and accommodates LLM\'s limited capabilities to progressively complete tasks. The self-debugging and post-filtering modules further enhance reliability by diagnosing and correcting errors and pruning extraneous information. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including data analysis, visualization, and data modeling, show that DatawiseAgent consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods across multiple model settings. These results highlight its potential to generalize across data science scenarios and lay the groundwork for more efficient, fully automated workflows.', 2025, 'ArXiv', '', 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07044v1', 'cs.CL, cs.AI', 'cs.CL, cs.AI', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07044v1'),

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as assistants for data science, by suggesting ideas, techniques and small code snippets, or for the interpretation of results and reporting. Proper automation of some data-science activities is now promised by the rise of LLM agents, i.e., AI systems powered by an LLM equipped with additional affordances--such as code execution and knowledge bases--that can perform self-directed actions and interact with digital environments. In this paper, we survey the evaluation of LLM assistants and agents for data science. We find (1) a dominant focus on a small subset of goal-oriented activities, largely ignoring data management and exploratory activities; (2) a concentration on pure assistance or fully autonomous agents, without considering intermediate levels of human-AI collaboration; and (3) an emphasis on human substitution, therefore neglecting the possibility of higher levels of automation thanks to task transformation.', 2025, 'ArXiv', '', 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08800v1', 'cs.AI, cs.CL', 'cs.AI, cs.CL', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08800v1'),
